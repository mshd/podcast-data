      <title>Iowa Episode 4: The final sprint</title>
      <description>In episode four of this five-part series on the Iowa caucuses, we take you behind the scenes as the campaigns prepare for one of the biggest nights of the primary season, the Liberty and Justice Dinner. Obama’s speech at the event back in 2007 gave his candidacy an enormous boost, but we’ll explain why the evening is as much about what you say as how well you’ve organized. Then we’ll consider proposals to change the primary process that would reduce Iowa’s influence as we continue to wrestle with the question: is this really the best way to pick a president? This series is hosted by Tommy Vietor and produced by Pineapple Street Studios.

      <title>Iowa Episode 3: Endorsements, surrogates and criticisms of Iowa</title>
      <description>In episode three of this five-part miniseries on the Iowa caucuses, we dive into the all-important race to lock down the state’s key endorsements. These campaign surrogates, always critical, loom particularly large for the five US Senators running who may have to spend the bulk of January in impeachment hearings. We’ll also dig into all the criticisms of the Iowa caucuses, from the demographics of the state to the charge that the caucuses themselves are undemocratic. Plus: a ukulele. The series is hosted by Tommy Vietor and produced by Pineapple Street Studios.

      <itunes:summary>In episode three of this five-part miniseries on the Iowa caucuses, we dive into the all-important race to lock down the state’s key endorsements. These campaign surrogates, always critical, loom particularly large for the five US Senators running who may have to spend the bulk of January in impeachment hearings. We’ll also dig into all the criticisms of the Iowa caucuses, from the demographics of the state to the charge that the caucuses themselves are undemocratic. Plus: a ukulele. The series is hosted by Tommy Vietor and produced by Pineapple Street Studios.
