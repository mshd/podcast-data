In this episode we talk about the real affect globalisation has on the world, the failings of COP26, the manipulation occurring at governmental levels by billionaires, and how we can cultivate fearlessness in order to stand up against the powerful to fight for what’s right and necessary.

David is an expert in the areas of trauma intervention and conflict resolution. He is the creator of Tension & Trauma Releasing Exercises which are designed to help release the deep tension created in the body--during a traumatic experience, or through chronic stress.  In this episode, we discuss the idea of post-traumatic growth: Do we grow and learn from our trauma, and does it ultimately makes us stronger? Where and why do we store trauma in our bodies and what are subsequent consequences? David teaches people, through his simple TRE exercises, how to release trauma from the body in order to aid illness, both physical and mental. He tells me how he discovered these techniques; we discuss the similarities these techniques have with ecstatic states and transcendent bodily feelings; and how some of us are so conditioned to be composed at all times we’ve lost the ability to relax, let go, or even cry.

Edward Snowden is a renowned US whistleblower and former computer intelligence consultant who worked for CIA & NSA. He copied and leaked highly classified information from the NSA in 2013 when he was a CIA employee. His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments He has written a book about his life called \"Permanent Record”, which is available now.  In this discussion Edward discusses the idea of being a called “hero” and difference between that and heroism. He speaks about his history and why he did what he did. We talk about the true power of the state, corporations and Big Tech, the popularity of conspiracy theories and how the real “conspiracies” and atrocities are occurring in plain sight. We don’t need to look far to find corruption.   Next week’s podcast will be with Marianne Williamson!

We debate the idea of progressivism and whether we should celebrate or be suspect of the progress societies and cultures have made. Are we being duped? I question Jordan on why he is so popular among men and why he is often criticised and disliked by women. We dissect some of those famous media interviews.

For more information on David’s work or if you would like some support around grief or bereavement go to grief.com  In this podcast we discuss our inability to accept death and the struggles we encounter when faced with grief. Has society whitewashed death and hidden it from sight, so much so that we think that it’s never going to happen to us? David’s work and mission is to help us find meaning when we are grieving - something he has had to negotiate first hand after the death of his mother and son. He helps us understand how we can still have an emotional and spiritual relationship with those who have passed. Are some of our cultures grief illiterate and are ultimately making the pain so much worse? Should we start speaking about death more openly in order to help us interface with the one thing that is inevitably going to affect us all?

Nick is an author, illustrator, print-maker and political cartoonist. He has published four highly acclaimed graphic novels, each one in separate ways focuses on mankind’s relationship with the environment. I’ve just read his latest book The Book of Trespass: Crossing the Lines That Divide Us, that came out last year. It my favourite Christmas present!  We discuss the nature of trespassing and the social, political and cultural impacts it has on us. We only have access to 8% of the English countryside, the rest is hidden behind walls and protected by private property laws. Why can’t we swim in a river? Or roam through a forest? Why do these laws exist and why aren’t they being challenged? Nick explains the history of how trespassing laws came into existence and what he is doing to change them with his Right to Roam campaign. Is private property law furthering the disconnection we have with nature and pushing it towards commodification? Has this also become a class issue, where nature and natural beauty spots are now reserved for those who can pay to access them?

Carlo works mainly in the field of quantum gravity and is a founder of loop quantum gravity theory. Carlo’s books ‘Seven Brief Lessons on Physics’, ‘Reality Is Not What It Seems’, and ‘The Order of Time’ are international bestsellers which have been translated into 43 languages. His new book, “There are Places in the World Where Rules are Less Important than Kindness” is published next month and features his reflections on everything, from Newton’s alchemy to Einstein’s mistakes, to the consciousness of an octopus, hallucinogens and the meaning of atheism.  In this podcast we discuss the history of science and religion, how our knowledge of quantum theory and mechanics can effect our sense of morality and reality and we explore the nature of consciousness from Carlo’s perspective of theoretical physicist.

What will make the majority of people change the way they behave?    Activism  Kate’s conservation work is currently centred in supporting two plastic activism causes:   1. Plastic Free Byron: a local initiative to help her hometown phase out single-use plastics. She is fundraising this through \"Products with Purpose\" that can be purchased on her website and she is documenting the process as a case study for others to implement in their towns.  2. Plastic Health Summit: an international summit on the emerging science on plastic's impact on humans and the environment. She is helping to report on and amplify this breaking research this month.   Follow her on Instagram for entertaining educational solutions and tips to quit plastics PLUS updates on her current plastics activism campaigns.   She translates science for top international plastics researchers through fascinating and fun interviews on her Youtube channel and Instagram channel.

Adam is an Associate Professor of Marketing at New York University’s Stern School of Business and author of Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked - which considers why so many people today are addicted to so many behaviours, from incessant smart phone and internet use to playing video games and online shopping.   In this episode we discuss nature of tech addiction, how social media and tech are designed to turn us in addicts and what the moral and ethical questions are surrounding that premise.

In this podcast we delve into what it’s like striving for fame and affirmation to then denounce it all in favour of living a spiritual life.    Info Yusuf / Cat Stevens is a British singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. His musical style consists of folk, pop, rock, and, in his later career, Islamic music.  He was one of the most successful and beloved artists of the 1960s and 1970s but left his musical career behind to devote himself to educational and philanthropic causes in the Muslim community.  He has been awarded two honorary doctorates and the Man of Peace Award for his humanitarian work. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.
