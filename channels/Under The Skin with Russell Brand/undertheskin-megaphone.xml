    <description>A weekly interview series from Russell Brand that examines what's beneath the surface—of the people we admire, the ideas that define our time, and the history we’re told. Speaking with guests from the worlds of academia, popular culture, and the arts, Russell seeks to uncover the ulterior truth behind our constructed reality. And have a laugh.
On his new podcast ‘Above the Noise’ Russell guides us all—curious beginners, spiritual skeptics, and experienced practitioners—in brief, 10-minute meditations. Listen to Above the Noise on Luminary</description>

      <title>#213 Fearlessness and Fighting Power (with Dr. Vandana Shiva)</title>
      <description>This week I was fortunate to have Vandana Shiva return as a guest on the podcast. Her first interview on Under the Skin was one of my favourites, and as many of you noticed, moved me very much. Vandana is an Indian scholar, food sovereignty advocate, and environmental activist. She is author of: Oneness vs. the 1%: Shattering Illusions, Seeding Freedom. She is powerful, compassionate, and incredibly well educated. In this episode we talk about the real affect globalisation has on the world, the failings of COP26, the manipulation occurring at governmental levels by billionaires, and how we can cultivate fearlessness in order to stand up against the powerful to fight for what’s right and necessary.
For more information on Vandana’s work and to take part in her online courses go to navdanya.org

      <title>#211 Fighting Corruption Using a Spiritual Perspective (with Sarah Chayes)</title>
      <description>This week’s episode is fantastic! I am joined by Sarah Chayes, who was recommended to me during my episode with Sebastian Junger. Sarah Chayes is an author and a journalist, and has worked as a political advisor. She writes primarily about the nature of corruption. Her books include Thieves of State: Why Corruption Threatens Global Security, and most recently: On Corruption in America: And What Is at Stake which is coming out in paperback in the US next week.

This is a fascinating conversation with someone who possesses incredible experience. Sarah talks about her time in Afghanistan, her stint as a political advisor to the military, and her understanding of corruption that exists at every level of power. We get deep and philosophical about how this affects us as humans, and how we can fight corruption. 

In the UK Sarah’s book On Corruption in America is titled Everybody Knows: Corruption in America if you’re looking to buy a copy.More Info:

      <title>#210 Is There a Point to Left Wing Politics? (with Jeremy Gilbert)</title>
      <description>This week I spoke with Jeremy Gilbert. Jeremy is a Professor of Cultural and Political Theory at the University of East London. He is author of Twenty-First Century Socialism, and his latest book Hegemony Now: How Big Tech and Wall Street Won the World is out next year.
 
As a big fan of the late Mark Fisher’s work, particularly his book Capitalist Realism (for which I did the audiobook recording), I was intrigued to learn that Mark and Jeremy were associates. And I felt very compelled to speak to Jeremy about his work and outlook on politics. This episode is a very down-to-earth, realistic and in-depth discussion about the work of the left wing in politics. What does the left stand for? What are they doing right now? Is it working? What needs to happen next?

      <title>#208 Emergency Power (with Dr. Luke Kemp)</title>
      <description>This week I spoke with a brilliant researcher, Dr. Luke Kemp. Luke is a research associate at the Centre for The Study of Existential Risk at Cambridge University. He is an incredible source of information regarding state power, control, what happens governmentally in times of crises, and the subsequent impact on citizens. We speak about the use of Emergency Powers and the abuse of these powers, too: how and why they are employed, and why they are often never taken away once implemented. 

For more info on Luke’s work and a reading list, go here: https://www.cser.ac.uk/news/meet-researcher-dr-luke-kemp/

      <title>#207 Dopamine Culture (with Dr. Anna Lembke)</title>
      <description>Author of Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence, psychiatrist Dr. Anna Lembke joins me this week to talk about pleasure, pain, dopamine, and the brain! This is a fantastic episode. Dr. Anna explains how our brains are constantly trying to maintain a state of homeostasis—amid the relentless seesaw between pleasure and pain. The consequences of our actions will be felt on this seesaw; she tells us how we can manage the back and forth, in order to try and find balance in our lives.

      <title>#206 Evolution and Ideology (with Heather Heying and Bret Weinstein)</title>
      <description>This week I’m joined by evolutionary biologist Heather Heying, and biologist Bret Weinstein to discuss their new book A Hunter-Gatherer's Guide to the 21st Century: Evolution and the Challenges of Modern Life. In this episode we discuss how the rapid acceleration of change in the modern world is proving difficult for us as humans to adapt to. What elements of these changes are challenging and why? What should we be doing to make sure we are able to live happily in the society we are creating?

      <title>#205 What Does Capitalism Mean? (With Anwar Shaikh)</title>
      <description>This week we get deep into capitalism. Anwar Shaikh is a heterodox economist,  founding member of the Union of Radical Political Economists, and Professor of Economics at The New School for Social Research in New York City.  His latest book Capitalism: Competition, Conflict, Crisis has been widely acclaimed as one of the most important works of economic theory to have come from the Left in many years. 

Anwar explains how and why capitalism works, and the consequences of having it as the dominant economic operating system in the world. What does that really mean?! Anwar will tell you.

      <title>#204 A Global Health Con and How To Stop It (with Dr. Bob Gill)</title>
      <description>This week’s episode is very important. Today I spoke with Dr. Bob Gill a British-based GP who is fighting against the privatisation of The NHS (In Britain, that is the National Health Service.) Dr. Gill explains, clearly and thoroughly, how our healthcare is being taken from us and given to private companies in order to fleece us for our money--and, even more devastatingly, to let those who can’t afford healthcare die. He breaks down the strategies used by corporations, by YOUR governments and by the media to slyly pass legislation that hands over your health to profit-driven CEOs. This is an urgent matter that affects everyone.

Please check out the links below and watch Dr. Bob’s film 'The Great NHS Heist' on YouTube.

Dr. Gill explains, clearly and thoroughly, how our healthcare is being taken from us and given to private companies in order to fleece us for our money--and, even more devastatingly, to let those who can’t afford healthcare die. He breaks down the strategies used by corporations, by YOUR governments and by the media to slyly pass legislation that hands over your health to profit-driven CEOs. This is an urgent matter that affects everyone.

      <title>#203 Should We Hijack Political Parties or Start A Revolution?</title>
      <description>This week I spoke with Krystal Ball. Krystal is a progressive American commentator who, along with right-wing commentator Saagar Enjeti, co-hosts the podcast/video show Breaking Points. (The duo previously hosted a popular show for The Hill.) 
Krystal and I discuss many of the issues that divide left and right-wing politics. We explore how politicians fear the media and thus are controlled by their narratives. I delve into whether or not Krystal, as a progressive, feels that her respect for the Democratic Party has been eroded. Plus, we reflect on actions and options: What should we do? Should we hijack a political party and use their position to make change, or should we start from scratch and start a revolution, scrapping the entire system completely? Krystal has some very interesting, balanced, and thoughtful ideas on all of these questions; her answers will appeal to those on every side of the political spectrum.

More info
Krystal also hosts a progressive podcast Krystal, Kyle &amp; Friends.

      <title>#202 The Moral Conundrums of Politics</title>
      <description>This week I spoke with Tim Pool. Tim is a journalist, activist, and one of the biggest political YouTubers of the moment. He initially became known for livestreaming the 2011 Occupy Wall Street protests.

Tim is also known for discussing some of the more difficult questions in relation to politics, including: the issues that divide The Left and The Right, and the issues that cause some of the biggest political fracas and conflicts in the US right now. What are the correct answers? Is it possible to bridge the political divide? Where does the question of individual sovereignty, morality, and civil rights come to a head? This episode tries to tackle those issues, or at least discuss them.

 Tim Pool operates four channels and a subscription model website TimCast.com.

      <title>#201 Finding Light (with John Higgs)</title>
      <description>This week I spoke with John Higgs! John is a writer, journalist and cultural historian. He writes extensively about William Blake and counter-cultural figures like Alan Moore and Timothy Leary. "William Blake vs the World" and "The Future Starts Here: Adventures in the Twenty-First Century" are just two examples of his work.
I am reading some of John’s books on William Blake at the moment and I’m really enjoying them. In this episode we discuss the magic and mysticism of William Blake and how reading his work can help us understand: the world in a more imaginative way, our various models of reality, the sublime and the divine, counter-cultural figures like the electronic band KLF who set fire to a million pounds, pragmatic optimism, and finding a new approach to dealing with the mysteries of the world!

      <title>#200 Your Mind On Plants (with Michael Pollan)</title>
      <description>This week’s guest is Michael Pollan! Michael is an american author and journalist. He is best known for his books that explore the socio-cultural impacts of food, such as The Botany of Desire and The Omnivore's Dilemma. His latest book is This Is Your Mind on Plants - in this book he explores in particular opium, caffeine, and mescaline.

We chat about Michael’s research on various drugs, from caffeine to psychedelics. We touch on the idea of transcendence, archetypes and reflect on the incredible power and intelligence all plants possess. They have been evolving a lot longer than we have, what else can they do that we’re not even aware of yet?

      <title> #199 Censorship and Consciousness (with Bret Weinstein)</title>
      <description>This week’s guest is Bret Weinstein! Bret is a professor of biology, an evolutionary theorist, and well known political and cultural commentator. He hosts the DarkHorse podcast with his wife Heather. His new book A Hunter-Gatherer's Guide to the 21st Century: Evolution and the Challenges of Modern Life is available to pre-order now.

We discuss censorship and the difficulty we have as a society at having open discourse and dialogue around controversial topics. Then we delve deep into our differing perspectives on consciousness, utopias and purpose. It’s a fantastic conversation, and Bret’s expertise in evolutionary biology, paired with his curiosity and openness, is wonderful to listen to.

      <title>#198 The Matter with Things (with Iain McGilchrist)</title>
      <description>This week I spoke to one of my favourite guests on Under the Skin - Iain McGilchrist. Iain is an author, psychiatrist and former Oxford literary scholar. He came to prominence with his publication "The Master and His Emissary - The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World”. His latest book is called “The Matter With Things.”

This is a fantastic podcast that discusses Iain’s work, the differences between the left and the right hemispheres, but also much more than that. We delve into some deep philosophical discussions about how we perceive and understand reality, God and the mystical; how being a spiritual person really is “no picnic;” and we speak about therapy, psychiatry, and the challenges we face when trying to help one another. It’s a wonderful conversation, and we will definitely be having Iain back again!

More Info:

The Matter With Things is coming out on 9th November and is available to pre-order here: https://channelmcgilchrist.com/the-matter-with-things/

      <title>#196 How To Shake Off Trauma (with Dr. David Berceli)</title>
      <description>This week I spoke with Dr. David Berceli. David is an expert in the areas of trauma intervention and conflict resolution. He is the creator of Tension &amp; Trauma Releasing Exercises which are designed to help release the deep tension created in the body--during a traumatic experience, or through chronic stress.

In this episode, we discuss the idea of post-traumatic growth: Do we grow and learn from our trauma, and does it ultimately makes us stronger? Where and why do we store trauma in our bodies and what are subsequent consequences? David teaches people, through his simple TRE exercises, how to release trauma from the body in order to aid illness, both physical and mental. He tells me how he discovered these techniques; we discuss the similarities these techniques have with ecstatic states and transcendent bodily feelings; and how some of us are so conditioned to be composed at all times we’ve lost the ability to relax, let go, or even cry.

For more information on David’s work go to: traumaprevention.com

        <![CDATA[<p>This week I spoke with Dr. David Berceli. David is an expert in the areas of trauma intervention and conflict resolution. He is the creator of Tension &amp; Trauma Releasing Exercises which are designed to help release the deep tension created in the body--during a traumatic experience, or through chronic stress.</p><p><br></p><p>In this episode, we discuss the idea of post-traumatic growth: Do we grow and learn from our trauma, and does it ultimately makes us stronger? Where and why do we store trauma in our bodies and what are subsequent consequences? David teaches people, through his simple TRE exercises, how to release trauma from the body in order to aid illness, both physical and mental. He tells me how he discovered these techniques; we discuss the similarities these techniques have with ecstatic states and transcendent bodily feelings; and how some of us are so conditioned to be composed at all times we’ve lost the ability to relax, let go, or even cry.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>For more information on David’s work go to: </strong><a href="http://traumaprevention.com">traumaprevention.com</a></p><p><br></p><p>I'm doing <strong>live dates </strong>in the UK this autumn with my new stand up show, '33'.

      <title>#195 The Underworld and The Underworld Within (with Robert Macfarlane)</title>
      <description>This week I spoke with Robert Macfarlane. Robert is a writer and a Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He is known for his books on landscape, nature, place, people and language. He is author of Underland and Mountains of the Mind: A History of a Fascination.

This is a beautiful and fascinating episode. Robert is an incredible writer and investigator into the natural world. He writes beautifully about our relationship with the underworld. We discuss Robert’s adventures into the world beneath us, the psychological and mythic correlations, our obsession with conquering nature, and our need to recognise the sacred in the world around us.

      <title>#194 The Jungian Perspective (with Lisa Marchiano)</title>
      <description>This week I spoke with Lisa Marchiano! Lisa is a Jungian analyst, author of Motherhood: Facing and Finding Yourself and co-host of This Jungian Life podcast.
In this episode we speak about Lisa’s new book about parenting, and how becoming a parent or taking on those responsibilities, is an incredible opportunity for growth. We learn so much about ourselves from the struggles and hardships we endure. Lisa also shares her knowledge about Jung and applies it to a variety of cultural events I put to her—from the Britney Spears conservatorship to the European Football Championship. Are we hardwired to worship and seek the transcendent in everything? Are there mythological tropes and narratives being played out in front our eyes that we can learn from? Let’s see.

      <title>#193 Prepare For The Apocalypse! (with Bradley Garrett)</title>
      <description>This week I spoke with Bradley Garrett. Bradley is a social geographer, explorer and photographer. He is author of Bunker: Building for the End Times and Explore Everything: Place-Hacking the City.

Bradley talks to us about his time writing about and living with “DoomsDay Preppers,” people who are preparing for the end of the world as we know it. Bradley has visited billionaire bunkers and lived with off-grid communities. He found that these people transcend political ideology, identity politics, or any kind of ideals. Their aim is to be prepared to live self-sufficiently and in harmony--in order to survive the worst!

What can we learn from this mentality and why has it come about?

      <title>#188 Bitcoin: Financial Revolution or Same Ol’ Story? (with Andrei Jikh)</title>
      <description>This week I am joined by Andrei Jikh! Andrei is a successful YouTube creator with nearly 1.5 million subscribers. His channel focuses on personal finance, investing and cryptocurrency. As some of you may be aware, I know very little about Bitcoin or how it works - so I’ve brought in Andrei to help break it down and answer all my questions. Andrei is an excellent communicator and explains how Bitcoin works, how it regulates itself, who started it, and if it can be used as a tool for change or revolution! Can governments and banks take back control or have we found something that truly challenges centralised power?

      <title>#187 Trauma and Israel (with Dr. Gabor Maté)</title>
      <description>This week the incredible Dr. Gabor Maté joins me again on the podcast.  
Gabor is a Hungarian-Canadian physician - he specialises in childhood development and trauma, and their potential lifelong impacts on physical and mental health - including addiction. He is a Jewish survivor of the Holocaust both his maternal grandparents were killed in Auschwitz when he was five months old. 
In this podcast we talk about the effect the pandemic has had on us, how it has revealed our governments priorities, the relentless power of corporations, and what we need to change in our culture to prevent a sense of dislocation. I also ask Gabor speak on the Palestine and Israel conflict. He is an extremely compassionate, educated and wise person to listen to.  
Let me know what you think of it.

Gabor’s new book The Myth of Normal: Illness and Health in an Insane Culture is coming out next year!

      <title>#183 Inside The Presidential Campaign (with Marianne Williamson)</title>
      <description>This week’s guest is Marianne Williamson! Marianne is an author, non-profit and political activist, and spiritual thought leader. For over three decades Marianne has been a leader in spiritual and religiously progressive circles. She is the author of 14 books, four of which have been #1 New York Times best sellers. In 2019, she announced her campaign for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 United States presidential election.

The first time Marianne was a guest on on Under The Skin it was at the time she just announced she was running for President 2020. This time, she reflects on her time in the belly of the beast, reveals what surprised her and the revelations that give her optimism moving forward now. This is a fantastic conversation with someone who first hand has challenged the current system and provided us with an alternative perspective that should and could be incorporated into politics right now.

This is a fantastic conversation with someone who first hand has challenged the current system and provided us with an alternative perspective that should and could be incorporated into politics right now.</p><p><br></p><p>Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/williamsonmarianne">https://www.facebook.com/williamsonmarianne</a> </p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/marwilliamson">@marwilliamson</a> </p><p>Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mariannewilliamson/">https://www.instagram.com/mariannewilliamson/</a></p><p>YouTube: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MarianneWilliamson">www.youtube.com/user/MarianneWilliamson</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Marianne Williamson Podcast</strong></p><p><a href="https://luminary.link/4ml84hmsFfb">https://luminary.link/4ml84hmsFfb</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Website</strong>: <a href="http://www.marianne.com">www.marianne.com</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Book:</strong> <strong>A POLITICS OF LOVE: <em>A Handbook for a New American Revolution</em></strong></p><p><a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/a-politics-of-love-marianne-williamson/1128745899">https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/a-politics-of-love-marianne-williamson/1128745899</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>More Info:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>My new <strong>meditation podcast Above the Noise</strong> is out now only on Luminary, I will be releasing guided meditations every Wednesday, please check out it: <a href="http://luminary.link/meditate">http://luminary.link/meditate</a> </p><p><br></p><p>Elites are taking over!

      <title>#182 Conspiracy in Plain Sight (with Edward Snowden)</title>
      <description>This week is an incredible episode with Edward Snowden!
Edward Snowden is a renowned US whistleblower and former computer intelligence consultant who worked for CIA &amp; NSA. He copied and leaked highly classified information from the NSA in 2013 when he was a CIA employee. His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments He has written a book about his life called "Permanent Record”, which is available now.

In this discussion Edward discusses the idea of being a called “hero” and difference between that and heroism. He speaks about his history and why he did what he did. We talk about the true power of the state, corporations and Big Tech, the popularity of conspiracy theories and how the real “conspiracies” and atrocities are occurring in plain sight. We don’t need to look far to find corruption. 

Next week’s podcast will be with Marianne Williamson!

      <title>#181 The Martyr of The Culture Wars (with Jordan Peterson)</title>
      <description>Jordan Peterson returns for a third time on Under the Skin, but this one is much different than the others. For those who are new to Jordan, he is a professor of psychology and clinical psychologist. He is author of 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos and his latest book Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life is out now.

In this we discuss Jordan’s personal circumstances and the powerful effect community, friends and family had in his recovery. We cover everything from politics, spirituality and individualism, to how can it be possible to remain positive and optimistic when we often experience so much malevolence in the world? We debate the idea of progressivism and whether we should celebrate or be suspect of the progress societies and cultures have made. Are we being duped? I question Jordan on why he is so popular among men and why he is often criticised and disliked by women. We dissect some of those famous media interviews. A lot more than this is covered in this conversation, particularly in the second hour - you will have to listen to come to your own conclusions on these matters! 

More Info

      <title>#180 Oneness Vs The 1% (with Vandana Shiva)</title>
      <description>This week’s guest on Under The Skin is Vandana Shiva. Vandana is an Indian scholar, food sovereignty advocate and environmental activist. Her latest book is called: Oneness VS the 1%: Shattering Illusions, Seeding Freedom.
This is an incredible podcast, with a very powerful, intelligent and wise human being. Vandana speaks about the dangers of big tech, corporate monopolies and their mission to colonise our lives and the earth. She explains to us how their perspective on land ownership, food production and innovation is all wrong, naming Bill Gates as one of the worst perpetrators.
Vandana gives her thoughts on what we should be doing, how we should be viewing the world and agriculture and encourages us to return to oneness rather than creating more division.
For more information on Vandana’s work and to take part in her online courses go to navdanya.org
Also please check out the documentary film about Vandana’s work “The Seeds of Vandana” here: https://vandanashivamovie.com

      <title>#179 The Neuroscience Behind Our Emotional Lives (with Lisa Feldman Barrett)</title>
      <description>This week’s guest is Lisa Feldman Barret. Lisa is author of Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain and How Emotions are Made. 
She is a Professor of psychology at Northeastern University where she focuses on affective science. 
Her focus is on understanding the nature of emotion in the brain.

In this podcast Lisa explains the psychology and neuroscience behind how emotions are created in the brain, what affects our understanding of our emotions and how we try and often fail and “read” others.

      <title>#178 Breathe! (with James Nestor)</title>
      <description>This week I spoke with James Nestor! James is author of Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art and DEEP: Freediving, Renegade Science, and What The Ocean Tells Us about Ourselves.

James, inspired by the art of freediving, has explored the vital role breath and breathing correctly plays in our evolution as human beings and our health right now. Are we breathing wrong and what can we do to change it? How powerful is our breath really?
James reveals the incredible feats and control people have acquired by harnessing their breath, something we carry around with us 24/7. Is there some ulterior reason why this free, accessible and innate ability is not widely proliferated? This podcast may make you very aware of your breathing while you’re listening, but it might also change your life!

      <title>#177 Interconnection (with Merlin Sheldrake)</title>
      <description>This week I spoke with Merlin Sheldrake! Merlin is a biologist and author of Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds and Shape Our Futures. He has a background in plant sciences, microbiology, ecology, and the history and philosophy of science. 
In this podcast we discuss the incredible world fungi. Merlin helps us understand how much of of world around us is due to the power of change these organisms can affect and the fundamental role they play in creation and destruction. Fungi can even be used to solve some of the ecological challenges we face, if utilised correctly. They demonstrate to us how really interconnected we all are. Could learning about this underground often invisible world help us create a more interconnected and harmonious world? Listen and let us know know what you think!

      <title>#175 Death, Grief &amp; Finding MEANING (with David Kessler)</title>
      <description>David Kessler is a death and grieving expert and author of many books including - The Needs of the Dying: A Guide for Bringing Hope, Comfort, and Love to Life’s Final Chapter and Finding Meaning: The Sixth Stage of Grief.
For more information on David’s work or if you would like some support around grief or bereavement go to grief.com 
In this podcast we discuss our inability to accept death and the struggles we encounter when faced with grief. Has society whitewashed death and hidden it from sight, so much so that we think that it’s never going to happen to us?
David’s work and mission is to help us find meaning when we are grieving - something he has had to negotiate first hand after the death of his mother and son. He helps us understand how we can still have an emotional and spiritual relationship with those who have passed. Are some of our cultures grief illiterate and are ultimately making the pain so much worse? Should we start speaking about death more openly in order to help us interface with the one thing that is inevitably going to affect us all?
This is a very moving and uplifting podcast episode, that we hope will help all of us during this time of loss.

      <title>#174 The Horror of Brand Power (with Joel Bakan)</title>
      <description>Joel Bakan is an American-Canadian writer, filmmaker, and professor at the Peter A. Allard School of Law at the University of British Columbia.
Joel has recently published a book, The New Corporation: How “Good” Corporations are Bad for Democracy, and released a documentary film based upon it. You can find out more about both at joelbakan.com.
In Joel’s early documentary film “The Corporation” he famously said that corporations are psychopaths. In this podcast we extrapolate from that discuss how power has shifted from government to corporations as they try to take over every aspect of our lives. What does this mean for democracy? How much power are we willing to give over to these companies? And are they really trying to do “good” or is just a facade to yield more control and ultimately...profit? This is what Joel explores further in his new film and book, he talks about his trip to Davos and the people and CEOs he encountered there who endeavour to change the world, but is it for the better? </description>

      <title>#172 Can’t Get Him Out Of My Head Part #1 (with Adam Curtis)</title>
      <description>Welcome to Part #1 of Under The Skin with the incredible Adam Curtis. Adam is a documentary filmmaker and a previous beloved guest on Under The Skin! In his films he explores areas of sociology, psychology, philosophy and political history.

His latest documentary, Can't Get You Out Of My Head: An Emotional History of the Modern World, is a 6-part series that you can now watch on the BBC. 

In Part #1 of this conversation we discuss Adam’s new documentary where he explores how as individuals we internalise power structures and how we feel doesn’t always come from within but where we are in relation to power. We discuss and debate ideas around progressivism, psychologising, religious ideology and our visions for how we feel the world should go about change.

It is, as with all Adam Curtis content, a very enlightening and thought provoking podcast. Let us know how what you thought of it!

      <title>#171 Understanding Our Divided Realities (with Jonathan Haidt)</title>
      <description>This week on Under The Skin is the long awaited guest Jonathan Haidt. Jonathan is an American social psychologist and professor. He is author of The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion, and The Coddling of the American Mind. His main areas of study are the psychology of morality and moral emotions.

This is a longer than usual podcast as it delves deep into the root of the division that proliferates every aspect of our political and cultural life right now. We obviously discuss US politics but not just that - we chat about how the goal of The Left to dismantle power has changed and mutated of the years - shifting from economics to identity issues. Jonathan explains some of his findings when researching the psychology of transcendence, we discuss fundamentalism and debate the idea progressivism.

A lot is covered in this podcast, enjoy!

      <title>#170 Self-Awareness &amp; Parenting (with Philippa Perry)</title>
      <description>This week’s guest on Under The Skin Philippa Perry! Philippa is a psychotherapist &amp; author, she is also married to the artist Grayson Perry. Her latest book The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read (And Your Parents Will Be Glad That You Did) has just been released in Paperback with a new chapter on Siblings.

This is a fantastic conversation about self-awareness, projection and parenting. How do we stop ourselves passing on our own trauma and bad habits onto our kids? What is the best way to nurture your relationship with a child? Philippa and I discuss our own personal experience as parents, therapy and individualism, art as a language and form expression and our two different perspectives on spirituality.

Philippa’s book The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read (And Your Parents Will Be Glad That You Did) his out now on paperback:

      <title>#168 Holocaust Survivor: ‘Is History Repeating Itself?’ (with Dr. Edith Eger)</title>
      <description>This week’s guest on Under The Skin is Dr. Edith Eger. Edith is a Holocaust survivor and a specialist in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. Her latest book The Gift - 12 Lessons To Save Your Life, shows us how to stop destructive patterns and imprisoning thoughts in order to find freedom and enjoy life. It is available now. 
I think it is important at this time of crisis, chaos and conflict to hear a voice from someone who survived the most extreme situation in recent history, The Holocaust. At a time of much division and hateful rhetoric, confusion from all sides, here is a voice that can be truly unifying.

      <title>#167 Crossing boundaries and Reclaiming land (with Nick Hayes)</title>
      <description>This week’s guest is Nick Hayes! Nick is an author, illustrator, print-maker and political cartoonist. He has published four highly acclaimed graphic novels, each one in separate ways focuses on mankind’s relationship with the environment. I’ve just read his latest book The Book of Trespass: Crossing the Lines That Divide Us, that came out last year. It my favourite Christmas present!

We discuss the nature of trespassing and the social, political and cultural impacts it has on us. We only have access to 8% of the English countryside, the rest is hidden behind walls and protected by private property laws. Why can’t we swim in a river? Or roam through a forest? Why do these laws exist and why aren’t they being challenged? Nick explains the history of how trespassing laws came into existence and what he is doing to change them with his Right to Roam campaign. Is private property law furthering the disconnection we have with nature and pushing it towards commodification? Has this also become a class issue, where nature and natural beauty spots are now reserved for those who can pay to access them?

This is a particularly fascinating podcast that will hopefully inspire you to explore more and join Nick in his Right to Roam campaign.

      <title>#165 The War For Your Consciousness (with Tristan Harris)</title>
      <description>This week’s guest on Under The Skin is the incredibly insightful and innovative Tristan Harris. You may recognise him from the The Social Dilemma documentary on Netflix. If you haven’t watched it yet, it’s a must see. Tristan is Co-Founder &amp; President of the Center for Humane Technology and Co-Host of the Your Undivided Attention podcast. Rolling Stone magazine named Tristan one of “25 People Shaping the World” and was named in Fortune’s 40 under 40 of 2018 for his work on reforming technology.

If you have a smartphone, use social media, communicate via email or use online services in any way…this podcast is for you. Tristan explains the power of the attention economy, reveals how these social media sites are engineered to capture our time but discusses how he is optimistic that positive change is possible in the tech industry. Can we ensure that our future doesn’t turn into products merely mined for our attention, time and data. How can we can change these algorithmic paradigms to serve us rather than the other way around?

      <title>#164 Genetic Revolution (with Bruce Lipton)</title>
      <description>Today’s guest on Under The Skin is Bruce Lipton! Bruce is a developmental biologist, stem cell biologist, notable for his views on epigenetics. He is the bestselling author of The Biology of Belief.
This is a fascinating conversation about how our environment effects our biology. How do our cells operate and how do they make us who we are?
Bruce explains how we are programmed from a young age through behaviour and culture. He explains how we can reprogram ourselves to live more fulfilling lives using energy psychology. He also discusses some of the scientific breakthroughs he has while working as a stem cell biologist. If we can learn understand how our biology works can we engineer our lives to be most spiritually satisfying and free us from suffering?

      <description>This week’s guest on Under The Skin is the world famous singer and incredible activist and philanthropist Annie Lennox. Annie is most well known as the front woman of The Eurythmics! 
She has won X4 Grammy’s and has sold over 83 million albums worldwide! Annie has just released THE 10th ANNIVERSARY RE-ISSUE of her album A CHRISTMAS CORNUCOPIA, that includes the single “Dido’s Lament”. 
This is a beautiful, warm and creative podcast in which we speak about gift and purpose and Annie’s life as a singer being skyrocketed into fame in the 80s. We share our feelings on being performers, the art of communing with the sacred, how music and art are a form communication and purpose, but how the fame that accompanies it can destroy the artist. We also discuss activism, and how painful it can be to interface with the cruel realities we see so many people deal with. How can we change the world? Is it even possible? What is our purpose?

More Info:
Annie’s new single, “DIDO’S LAMENT” is available now:

      <title>#160 Theology &amp; Rhyming (with Tim Minchin)</title>
      <description>This week’s podcast is an energetic, wordy and occasionally heated (in a good way!) with the incredible musician and artist Tim Minchin. Tim is an Australian comedian, actor, writer, musician, and songwriter. He is best known for his musical comedy! His new album ‘Apart Together’ will be released on Friday 20 November. 
We discuss everything from creativity and politics to whether or not your view on the origin of consciousness can determine whether we can change the world for the better. Tim is a rationalist and atheist, he explains his world view and how he finds beauty and comfort in a meaningless universe. On the other hand, I argue that spirituality and meaning is needed to supersede the current capitalist and materialist society that is no longer serving and nurturing our needs. 
Let us know what you think of the discussion on social media! 

Tim’s debut studio album, Apart Together, is available now:

      <title>#159 From Pain to Awakening (with Gabrielle Bernstein)</title>
      <description>This week’s guest is Gabrielle Bernstein! Gabrielle is an American motivational speaker, life coach and New York Times best-selling author of The Universe Has Your Back: Transform Fear to Faith and Super Attractor: Methods for Manifesting a Life Beyond Your Wildest Dreams. 

She teaches primarily from the text “A Course In Miracles” on the practical application of self-love, forgiveness and how to have a holistic approach to spirituality. 

We had a great conversation about how we are looking after ourselves during the challenges 2020 has presented. How should we be implementing our own spiritual practices in order to grow from very particular and peculiar challenges? Gabrielle explains some excellent therapy techniques, particularly the Internal Family Systems practice, a therapy that has helped her considerably. We also discuss the notion of “spiritual bypassing”, something that we all may fall prey to, where we try and use our spirituality or meditation to bypass difficult feelings and situations, rather than incorporating those challenges into our practices. It is a very connected and grounding podcast that we hope you get something from! 

MORE INFO 
On January 1st, Gabby will be leading a 21 day manifesting challenge. A step-by-step how to feel good while you turn what you want into the life you live using the manifesting methods Gabby uses everyday. You’ll discover how to act in alignment with the energy of the Universe, allowing good things to flow to you easily and naturally.

      <title>#158 Survival On The Edge Of Armageddon (with Ed Stafford)</title>
      <description>This week is the return of survivalist Ed Stafford! Ed is a survivor in every sense. This is great podcast on how to cope in an extreme world! We discussed everything from the effect the pandemic has had on us mentally, some solutions Ed has found it terms of honing our bushcraft skills and interacting with the natural world in order to feel connected. Ed reveals what life in the military was like and we open up on how crippling loneliness can be, not just during these Covid-times, but in our lives in general. What is it we really need, to live meaningfully and happily?

      <title>#157 Genius In Man &amp; Nature. Where Does It Come From? (with Carlo Rovelli)</title>
      <description>This week’s podcast is with theoretical physicist Carlo Rovelli. Carlo works mainly in the field of quantum gravity and is a founder of loop quantum gravity theory. Carlo’s books ‘Seven Brief Lessons on Physics’, ‘Reality Is Not What It Seems’, and ‘The Order of Time’ are international bestsellers which have been translated into 43 languages. His new book, “There are Places in the World Where Rules are Less Important than Kindness” is published next month and features his reflections on everything, from Newton’s alchemy to Einstein’s mistakes, to the consciousness of an octopus, hallucinogens and the meaning of atheism.

In this podcast we discuss the history of science and religion, how our knowledge of quantum theory and mechanics can effect our sense of morality and reality and we explore the nature of consciousness from Carlo’s perspective of theoretical physicist. Enjoy!

      <title>#156 Salvation &amp; Apocalypse In The Metamodern World (with Seth Abramson)</title>
      <description>This week’s guest on Under The Skin is the rather incredible meta modern journalist and political analyst Seth Ambramson! Seth is an American professor, attorney, author, and political columnist. His teaching areas include digital journalism, post-internet cultural theory, post-internet writing, and legal advocacy. He has written several books including Proof of Corruption: Bribery, Impeachment, and Pandemic in the Age of Trump (2020) and Proof of Conspiracy: How Trump's International Collusion Is Threatening American Democracy (2019). 
We we drill down into why the political landscape is the way it is, if Donald Trump is the problem or actually just a symptom and how postmodernism created a culture of hopelessness! Seth proposes the benefits of the metamodernist approach and explains how the most rebellious amongst us aren’t those reliving the punk attitudes of the 70s but the people who are putting themselves out there, seemingly uncool and and being mocked for their efforts to create change. Enjoy!

MORE INFO

Seth’s new book Proof of Corruption is available now: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250273000 

Proof of Corruption concludes a series that includes 2018's Proof of Collusion and 2019's Proof of Conspiracy.

        <![CDATA[<p>This week’s guest on Under The Skin is the rather incredible meta modern journalist and political analyst Seth Ambramson! Seth is an American professor, attorney, author, and political columnist. His teaching areas include digital journalism, post-internet cultural theory, post-internet writing, and legal advocacy. He has written several books including Proof of Corruption: Bribery, Impeachment, and Pandemic in the Age of Trump (2020) and Proof of Conspiracy: How Trump's International Collusion Is Threatening American Democracy (2019). </p><p>We we drill down into why the political landscape is the way it is, if Donald Trump is the problem or actually just a symptom and how postmodernism created a culture of hopelessness! Seth proposes the benefits of the metamodernist approach and explains how the most rebellious amongst us aren’t those reliving the punk attitudes of the 70s but the people who are putting themselves out there, seemingly uncool and and being mocked for their efforts to create change. Enjoy!</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>MORE INFO</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>Seth’s new book <strong><em>Proof of Corruption </em></strong>is available now: <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250273000">https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250273000</a> </p><p><br></p><p>Proof of Corruption concludes a series that includes 2018's Proof of Collusion and 2019's Proof of Conspiracy. </p><p><br></p><p>Listen to Seth’s podcast,<strong> <em>Proof: A Pre-Election Special</em></strong>, here:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_mrr4WnNM5peXgfFU443Cg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_mrr4WnNM5peXgfFU443Cg</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.sethabramson.net/"><strong>sethabramson.net</strong></a></p><p><strong>Twitter: </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/SethAbramson"><strong>@SethAbramson</strong></a></p><p><strong>Instagram: </strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/seth.abramson/"><strong>@seth.abramson</strong></a></p>]]>

      <title>#155 The Science Of Self &amp; ‘True’ Nature Of Reality (with Prof. Tom Oliver)</title>
      <description>This week’s guest on Under The Skin is Prof. Tom Oliver! Tom is a Professor in Ecology at the University of Reading, a socio-ecological systems expert and senior fellow with the UK government informing environmental policy. He is the author of The Self Delusion which explores how people, animals, plants and the planet we live on are all intimately connected – and why that matters. 
We had an incredible conversation about the science of the self, how we are all interconnected at a level that’s beyond our own senses, and if science can make us feel more connected one another? 

More Info on Tom: 
THE SELF DELUSION by Tom Oliver is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson in hardback, audio and ebook, and the paperback edition will be published on 21 January 2021.

      <title>#154 Why We Must Wake Up To Plastic Free Life (with Kate Nelson)</title>
      <description>This week I spoke with Kate Nelson (AKA Plastic Free Mermaid)! Kate is an avid waterwoman, science communicator, plastics consultant, and author of “I Quit Plastics: And You Can Too”.  

We discuss how imminent the need to change the way we consume is, whether we have any power to change production and challenge big corporations, and why the culture of environmentalism, recycling and farmer’s markets has bourgeois connotations. What will make the majority of people change the way they behave?  

Activism 
Kate’s conservation work is currently centred in supporting two plastic activism causes:  
1. Plastic Free Byron: a local initiative to help her hometown phase out single-use plastics. She is fundraising this through "Products with Purpose" that can be purchased on her website and she is documenting the process as a case study for others to implement in their towns. 
2. Plastic Health Summit: an international summit on the emerging science on plastic's impact on humans and the environment. She is helping to report on and amplify this breaking research this month. 

Follow her on Instagram for entertaining educational solutions and tips to quit plastics PLUS updates on her current plastics activism campaigns. 

She translates science for top international plastics researchers through fascinating and fun interviews on her Youtube channel and Instagram channel. She prioritises this work due to the incredibly negative health implications caused by our daily overexposure to plastics--from synthetic carpets to plastic packaging to fast fashion. When she learned plastic doesn't biodegrade, she quit using plastics. When she learned our contact with plastic causes obesity, developmental disorders, cancer, heart disease, and infertility--she dedicated her career to helping translate this important science. The science which competes with the convenience plastic offers.
Youtube: youtube.com/c/plasticfreemermaid 

Her book ‘I QUIT PLASTICS’ is available now: 
www.iquitplastics.com/book 

She offers in person Mermaid Retreats as well as an online Mermaid Retreat to adventure into one's higher purpose, deepen one's nature connection, meet like-minded mermaids, and quit plastics.

      <title>#153 Breathe Your Way To Freedom (with Biet Simkin)</title>
      <description>This week’s guest on Under The Skin is my friend Biet Simkin! 
Biet is a very popular meditation and breath work teacher. She has new book out called, “Don’t Just Sit There: 44 Insights to Get Your Meditation Practice Off the Cushion and Into the Real World” (https://amzn.to/2HD7UgY ). In this podcast talk about some of the 4th Way techniques that she employs in he work, we do a breath work demonstration and discuss how to inspire people to live a spiritual life without adding to the “woo woo” and skepticism that people often feel when presented with these ideas.

      <title>#152 Activism &amp; Spiritualism (with Satish Kumar)</title>
      <description>Hello! This week’s guest on Under The Skin is the incredible activist Satish Kumar! Satish been a Jain monk, a nuclear disarmament advocate, pacifist and he is the current editor of Resurgence &amp; Ecologist magazine of which he is very proud! Satish is next level.

He is well known for his 8,000 mile Peace Walk where he walked around the world with a friend with no money in protest of nuclear weapons. 

We spoke about the importance of localisaton, decentralisation and how we can create change and revolution now. We also discussed the need for the Social Justice Movement to be rooted in Environmental Justice in order for it to be holistic and powerful. Questions were raised as to whether icons of activism such as Gandhi and MLK should be scrutinised for their flaws? And how can we unify the people from all backgrounds to fight for change that will ultimately effect us all 

More info on Satish and his work:  
Satish is the editor emeritus of The Resurgence Trust, an environmental educational charity which publishes Resurgence &amp; Ecologist magazine, runs The Ecologist website and organises educational events www.resurgence.org

      <title>#151 Is The Rise Of Tech Addiction Really Irresistible? (with Adam Alter)</title>
      <description>This week’s guest on Under The Skin is Adam Alter! Adam is an Associate Professor of Marketing at New York University’s Stern School of Business and author of Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked - which considers why so many people today are addicted to so many behaviours, from incessant smart phone and internet use to playing video games and online shopping.  
In this episode we discuss nature of tech addiction, how social media and tech are designed to turn us in addicts and what the moral and ethical questions are surrounding that premise. Is it our fault that we are addicts? Should we just have more self-control? Or should the producers of these technologies be more responsible when designing these products? Could there be a hypocritical oath for tech giants, in order to protect us from becoming chained to our devices? 
Let us know what you thought of it on social media! 
Adam’s book “Irresistible” is available now.

Could there be a hypocritical oath for tech giants, in order to protect us from becoming chained to our devices? </p><p>Let us know what you thought of it on social media! </p><p><strong>Adam’s book “Irresistible” is available now.  </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>﻿</strong>US link: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Irresistible-Adam-Alter-audiobook/dp/B06WGMQBBM/">https://www.amazon.com/Irresistible-Adam-Alter-audiobook/dp/B06WGMQBBM/</a>  </p><p><br></p><p>UK link: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Irresistible-addicted-technology-yourself-free/dp/1784701653/%2523ace-3536363283">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Irresistible-addicted-technology-yourself-free/dp/1784701653/#ace-3536363283</a> </p><p><br></p><p><a href="http://adamalterauthor.com/">adamalterauthor.com</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Twitter:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/adamleealter">@adamleealter</a></p>]]>

      <title>#150 A Chance For Another Now (with Yanis Varoufakis)</title>
      <description>This week we have a returning guest to Under The Skin, and one of our favourites, Yanis Varoufakis! 
Yanis is a Greek economist, academic, philosopher and politician. A former member of Syriza, he served as Minister of Finance from January to July 2015. He is co-founder of the international grassroots movement, DiEM25, and in 2019 he won election as one of its representatives in the Greek Parliament. He is currently Professor of Economics at the University of Athens. 
These are just some of the topics we discussed; the current political climate, the failure of The Left, the difference between internationalism and globalisation, what a scalable socialist institution should and could look like, and the relationship between the working class and left-wing political parties. Yanis has an incredible insight into how all these institutions work, you’re bound to learn from this episode. 
If you enjoyed this episode, go back and listen to our first Under The Skin podcast together a few years ago! 
His new book, Another Now: Dispatches from an Alternative Present is released this month in hardback, ebook and audiobook.

They run The Bridget Healing Centre which is a centre for shamanic studies and spiritual empowerment and Glastonbury's most established healing centre.

      <title>#148 Fame &amp; The Spiritual Life (with Yusuf Cat Stevens)</title>
      <description>This week I spoke to one of most iconic sing-songwriters Yusuf Cat Stevens! In this podcast we delve into what it’s like striving for fame and affirmation to then denounce it all in favour of living a spiritual life.  

Info
Yusuf / Cat Stevens is a British singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. His musical style consists of folk, pop, rock, and, in his later career, Islamic music. 
He was one of the most successful and beloved artists of the 1960s and 1970s but left his musical career behind to devote himself to educational and philanthropic causes in the Muslim community. 
He has been awarded two honorary doctorates and the Man of Peace Award for his humanitarian work. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014. 
This year is the 50th anniversary of his iconic album, Tea for the Tillerman, and Yusuf / Cat Stevens is set to release the re-recorded and reimagined ‘Tea for the Tillerman²’ on 18th September.

      <title>#146 Access The Awareness Beyond (with Mooji)</title>
      <description>This week’s guest on Under The Skin is the incredible spiritual teacher Mooji. I practice a lot of Mooji’s meditations, which you can find on YouTube for free, and I’ve found them a really valuable asset to my daily spiritual practices.  

In this podcast Mooji answers a lot of my questions about meditation, identity and awareness, he also leads me in a guided meditation. I hope you will find this episode enlightening and educational. We have been looking forward to having him as a guest on Under The Skin for a long time! 

More info: 
Mooji is a renowned spiritual teacher, who, for over 20 years, has been guiding countless seekers worldwide in search of true happiness, peace and freedom.  
Mooji’s way of teaching is direct and compassionate, encouraging that Self-discovery need not be difficult. He teaches that the true nature of human beings is not a personal self or ego but pure, formless awareness.  
Mooji claims that when this is fully grasped, delusion and suffering come to an end and is replaced by a lasting peace and pure love. His talks, called Satsang, bring seekers into the experiential recognition of their true Self—and all with his characteristic humour, wisdom and love. 
His teachings are widely available online, and more info can be found at mooji.org.

      <title>#145 The Unified Field &amp; Limitless Potentialities </title>
      <description>This week I spoke with Dr. John Hagelin! John is a quantum physicist, public policy expert, President of the David Lynch Foundation and Chair of the Center for Leadership Performance.
For the past 25 years he has been leading a scientific investigation into the foundations of human consciousness and is one of the world’s pre-eminent researchers on the effects of meditation on brain development, and the use of meditation to address critical problems in the field of education, rehabilitation, crime, social violence, and post-traumatic stress.
Dr Hagelin teaches the doctoral program in physics at the Maharishi International University.
This is a very in depth conversation that marries the scientific world view with the spiritual. A fascinating, if sometimes challenging, but rewarding listen!</description>

      <title>#143 Tech Power &amp; Manipulation (with Brittany Kaiser)</title>
      <description>This week’s guest on Under The Skin is Brittany Kaiser. Brittany is the former business development director of Cambridge Analytica and you may recognise her from the Netflix Original documentary The Great Hack. She has incredible insight into the world of big data, political campaign management and strategy and how our every online move and word is being track, mined and sold for money and power. 
She co-founded the Digital Asset Trade Association (DATA), a non-profit lobbying firm advancing legislative reform for individuals to control their own digital assets. 
She also co-founded the Own Your Data Foundation, to promote digital literacy education. 
We discuss how our data is being collected and sold to corporations, governments and campaigns in order to manipulate our spending and even our voting choices. Should our data be seen and legally protected in the same way as property is? Is it wrong to target people based on their political leanings? Is it cheating? What laws are in place to protect us or is it fair game? 
Listen this week to find out from a person who has seen it all! 

Brittany’s book ‘Targeted: The Cambridge Analytica Whistleblower's Inside Story of How Big Data, Trump and Facebook Broke Democracy’ Is available now: https://www.harpercollins.com/products/targeted-brittany-kaiser

      <title>#142 Theories Of The Unknown (with Dr. Katie Mack)</title>
      <description>This week I spoke with theoretical astro-physicist and cosmologist Dr. Katie Mack! 
Katie has studied dark matter, the early universe, galaxy formation, black holes, cosmic strings, and the ultimate fate of the cosmos. We discuss all things known, unknown and speculative in this week’s podcast. We question how we can relate all of that to our everyday understanding of the world and societal beliefs. 
She is currently Assistant Professor of Physics at North Carolina State University and is regular columnist in Cosmos magazine and contributor to publications such as Scientific American, Slate, and Time. 

Katie’s new book “The End of Everything (Astrophysically Speaking)” is out in August.

      <title>#141 Finding God Without Losing Reason (with Radhanath Swami)</title>
      <description>This week’s guest is one my own close spiritual teachers - is Holiness Radhanath Swami.  
Radhanath Swami is one of today’s most beloved and respected spiritual teachers.  
He spent his youth wandering through disparate countries and cultures yearning for an experience of truth; after finally meeting his spiritual teacher in India he has spent the last 50 years internalising that spiritual practice and sharing it with others.  
He is not only a guide, but a community builder, activist, and a New York Times best-selling author. 
Radhanath Swami’s message is as profound as it is simple: by cultivating a rich inner life of self-awareness and a genuine practice of service, we can become instruments of compassion and agents of sustainable change in the world.</description>

      <title>#140 Is Panpsychism The Answer To The Mystery Of Consciousness? (with Dr. Philip Goff)</title>
      <description>This week’s podcast is all about Panpsychism! I spoke with philosopher Dr. Philip Goff, who teaches at Durham University who specialises in this area of research.
Philip the author of Consciousness and Fundamental Reality and Galileo’s Error and has published more than forty academic papers. His writing has also appeared in many newspapers and magazines, including The Guardian, The Times Literary Supplement, and Philosophy Now. 
Panpsychism argues that traditional approaches of materialism (consciousness can be explained in terms of physical processes in the brain) and dualism (consciousness is separate from the body and brain) face insuperable difficulties. 
In this podcast we discuss this idea more in depth an the implications it might have on scientific study and the way we relate to the world as a whole! Enjoy!
If you’d like learn more, check out Dr. Philip Goff’s book below:

      <title>#133 Healing The Seminal Wound (with Dr. James McLeary)</title>
      <description>This this week I spoke with Dr. James McLeary. James is a deeply experienced wisdom holder, expert facilitator and member of the Elder Council of Inside Circle Foundation. Inside Circle focuses on reducing prison violence, lowering recidivism, and guiding inmates through healing that allows for meaningful lives after release.
He is the executive producer of the documentary, THE WORK, detailing Inside Circle’s program in Folsom Prison.

I saw that documentary, you have to watch it, it’s a powerful documentary. He’s got a powerful energy and he knows the score on Jungian psychology, 12 Step Recovery and a lot of things and it’s a very interesting conversation. I think he’s talking about ways of setting up ceremonial space for us to deal with the deep truths about who we are and move from unconsciousness to consciousness, move out of the unaware habitual behaviours that condemn us to a life of bland consumerism, out of that into the fire of our potential awakened existence.</description>

      <title>#126 Is This The Opportunity for Revolution The World's Been Awaiting? (w/Charles Eisenstein)</title>
      <description>Charles Eisenstein returns to Under The Skin for a second time, this time with some interesting and in depth analysis on the current situation facing the world as Covid-19 begins to reframe how we see society and power. I was particularly inspired by Charles’s latest essay “The Coronation” - which you should read if you have the time.
In this podcast we discuss our relationship with death, our need for belief in authority and whether governments are preparing for civil unrest, conspiracy theories vs alternative ideas and Charles’s analysis on where we are going wrong and what we could be doing to make things right!</description>

      <title>#123 Mental Health Through Fitness (with Joe Wicks)</title>
      <description>This week I spoke with Joe Wicks. Joe is a fitness coach also known as "The Body Coach”. During this Covid-19 lockdown he has begun a daily morning YouTube Livestream called "P.E With Joe" to try and help children and adults stay active. His livestream has been viewed by millions and he has around 500,000 live viewers every morning!   
 
We chatted about the money he’s raised for the NHS from YouTube Live Streaming, the vital role the exercise plays in maintaining good mental health and what our post-pandemic world might look like. Will there be any changes to our behaviour? Or we will all go back to our lives as they were? Is this a time when the whole world will collectively wake up?</description>

      <title>#104 Science, Capitalism &amp; God (with Neil deGrasse Tyson)</title>
      <description>This week’s guest on Under The Skin is the infamous astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson! He’s pretty amazing. He was promoting his book ‘Letters From An Astrophysicist’ but he was more than that…being a focused and dedicated educator. I enjoyed talking to him. The main thrust of it was me going, “yeah, come on, there must be God!”. It was actually my ongoing argument that it’s hard to apply the tools of science to realms that may be beyond sensory experience and how can science claim to be objective as it exist within a capitalist consumer culture that has certain agendas and objectives? We also discussed the way in which science has propelled human understanding and how we interface with the unknowable, what role ancient spiritual texts have played and whether science is controlled by the rich and powerful?
I hope you enjoy it as much as we did!</description>
