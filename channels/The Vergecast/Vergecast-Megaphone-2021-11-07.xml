      <title>Land of the Giants: The Google Empire</title>
      <description>Vergecast is on vacation this week, so instead we'll share an episode of Land of the Giants from our friends at Recode.
Land of the Giants is a podcast that explores the five biggest tech companies and their impact on our world, and this season is all about Google.
The episode we're sharing tells the story of how two grad school students with a unique way to search the internet launched a company that would become the gateway to the internet for the entire world.
In the rest of the season, Land of the Giants: The Google Empire will cover issues like Google’s relationship with the government, the origins of their antitrust troubles, and what their future may look like as they face off against Congress and the Biden Administration.

      <title>Decoder: Alamo Drafthouse CEO on the future of movie theaters </title>
      <description>On this episode of Decoder, Nilay talks with Shelli Taylor, the CEO of Alamo Drafthouse. Shelli stepped into her new role as CEO during the pandemic.
In the conversation, Nilay and Shelli discuss the steps she had to take to get her company back on solid ground — including justifying high fixed costs of expensive lightbulbs — and how the government has failed to manage the pandemic effectively for business owners. They also talk about what it will take to safely reopen theaters and what the future looks like, especially in the streaming age.

      <title>Decoder: Microsoft's Phil Spencer on launching the new Xbox </title>
      <description>On this week’s episode of Decoder Nilay Patel talks to Phil Spencer, the guy in charge of Xbox at Microsoft. They discuss not only the next-generation Xbox and PS5 just arriving in stores now, but how gaming itself has become part of mainstream culture, a trend that has definitely accelerated during the pandemic. We’ve also reached an inflection point for game streaming: Google, Amazon, and Microsoft all have services that allow consumers to play games on any device by streaming them over the internet, kind of like Netflix for games. Is that the future?

      <title>Decoder: The future of remote learning with Sal Khan of Khan Academy</title>
      <description>For the next few Tuesday's, we'll be sharing Nilay Patel's new podcast Decoder, an interview show that puts a spotlight on how innovators and policymakers at the frontiers of business and technology are navigating an ever-changing landscape.
On this week’s episode of Decoder, Nilay Patel talks with Sal Khan, the co-founder and CEO of Khan Academy, a nonprofit online learning platform for students in kindergarten through high school. Khan Academy is an organization that exists because of technology. What started with Sal tutoring his niece in math over video using off the shelf cameras and software, has grown into an organization with nearly 20 million users per month, available in 46 languages and used in more than 190 countries. And online learning has gotten even more vital with the pandemic.
In this conversation, Nilay and Sal discuss the future of learning, what online education is good at and where it struggles, how Khan Academy is growing, and how Sal’s thinking about handling trickier subjects like history and social studies.

      <title>Introducing Decoder with Nilay Patel: Mark Cuban on the future of American business</title>
      <description>This is the first episode of Nilay Patel's new podcast Decoder, an interview show that will put a spotlight on how innovators and policymakers at the frontiers of business and technology are navigating an ever-changing landscape.
On the first episode of Decoder, Nilay interviews Mark Cuban. Mark is the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, he’s a tech investor, and is on the hit show, Shark Tank. The conversation, recorded as last week’s election results rolled in, covers how interwoven business, technology, and policy are, whether its 5G, or the NBA bubble, or AI, or his investments into healthcare -- if you want to understand the landscape of the future, you have to understand tech, you have to understand business, and you have to understand policy.

      <description>There’s a lot of information coming and going about the coronavirus, and the next steps for vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 — The Verge even has a newsletter dedicated to it.
But how do we asses all this information in a logical way, to prevent confusion, chaos, or something worse? The Verge’s Nilay Patel, Mary Beth Griggs and Nicole Wetsman talked to Dr. Natalie Dean, assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, about what we know so far about the timeline of a COVID-19 vaccine, and the best way to evaluate the flood of information coming in every day.

      <title>Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman welcomes you to Team Antitrust</title>
      <description>Antitrust criticism of big tech companies like Google, Apple, and Amazon have been louder than ever — from the consumers to the tech companies who compete with them. Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman has been vocal for years about the problem with Google’s dominant market share in maps, local search, and reviews.
“I’ve been working on it for over a decade and it’s great to see that more people have jumped on board.” Stoppelman says. “When we started out criticizing Google and highlighting some of their abuses, we got — especially from Silicon Valley — so many eye rolls.”
The Verge’s Nilay Patel and Casey Newton recently caught up with Stoppelman to discuss the evolving view of the media and the public on the tech monopolies, as well as how Yelp is handling their competition and what possible changes can be made with regulation from the government.

      <title>Introducing Land of the Giants: The Netflix Effect</title>
      <description>This week we’re sharing an episode of Land of the Giants, a podcast from our friends at Recode and the Vox Media Podcast Network that examines the most powerful tech companies of our time.
The second season is called The Netflix Effect, and it’s hosted by Recode editors Rani Molla and Peter Kafka.
The Netflix Effect explores how a company that began as a small DVD-by-mail service ultimately upended Hollywood and completely changed the way we watch TV.
It’s a fascinating look at what really goes on behind the scenes at Netflix, one of the few companies that’s actually growing during the pandemic, and how they’re continuing to transform entertainment for you and me.  
New episodes are released every Tuesday morning.

      <title>Basecamp CTO David Heinemeier Hansson and Rep. David Cicilline on Apple's monopolistic app store fees </title>
      <description>Apple is acting like a monopolist and a bully, according to the chairman of the House Antitrust Committee.
Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) joined The Vergecast along with Basecamp CTO David Heinemeier Hansson to discuss the plight of Hey, Basecamp’s new $99-a-year premium email service. Earlier this week, Heinemeier Hansson revealed that Apple had rejected the Hey iPhone app from the App Store because it didn’t offer any way to sign up and pay in the app itself — which would require giving Apple a 30 percent cut of the fee.

User engagement is up, as is interest around new product features, like video calls. More than six years after its launch, Tinder is finally introducing a one-on-one video calling feature that it says will be heavily moderated for content and safety. At the same time, Tinder CEO Elie Seidman says he and his team are focusing on how to keep young people coming to the app and how they can build digital relationships inside of it, especially as in-person dates slow down.Seidman joins Vergecast host Nilay Patel and Verge senior reporter Ashley Carman for a chat about the future of the platform, how it’ll keep people safe over video calls, and what happens to its Tinder U initiative that it’s focused on for years. Plus, he explains how Joe Exotic might be more important to a relationship than living near each other.

      <title>Amy Webb is a quantitative futurist</title>
      <description>Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel talks to founder and CEO of The Future Today Institute Amy Webb.
Amy is also a professor at NYU's Stern School of Business and recently came out with a book called The Big Nine: How the Tech Titans and Their Thinking Machines Could Warp Humanity. 
During the coronavirus pandemic, Amy and Nilay discuss whether we could have predicted this outbreak, how it can change trends in the future, and how it may even accelerate trends like AI and cloud-based robotics.
They also talk about The Future Today Institute's 2020 Tech Trend Report that was released this month — which is a quantitative look at the big trends that may dominate the future.

      <title>Argo’s CEO explains why its fleet of self-driving taxis won’t be all-electric (at first)</title>
      <description>One of the burning questions facing the world of self-driving cars is whether it makes sense to go all-electric or not. Some, like GM-owned Cruise, is all in on battery-electric vehicles. Others are going half-and-half, like Waymo building a fleet that includes both all-electric Jaguar I-Pace SUVs and gas-burning Chrysler Pacifica minivans.
Argo, the Pittsburgh-based self-driving company backed by Ford and Volkswagen, has concerns about an all-electric fleet, especially when it comes to the need to recoup the cost of all the expensive technology that makes the car autonomous. The company’s CEO, Brian Salesky, sat down with The Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel and senior reporter Andrew Hawkins to explain why.

      <title>New Jersey’s former attorney general on Ring cameras and facial recognition</title>
      <description>In this week’s Vergecast, former New Jersey attorney general Anne Milgram stopped by the studio to talk with Verge editor in chief Nilay Patel and me, senior reporter Colin Lecher.
As Nilay notes, Milgram, who also co-hosts the podcast Stay Tuned with Preet Bharara, is “the first cop we’ve ever had on the show,” and gave some thoughtful responses to questions about surveillance, predictive policing, and more.
“We all, I think, have the right reaction, which is we don’t want to use data that’s biased or we don’t want to have problems,” Milgram says. “And yet in our personal lives, we give access to a huge amount of information and a lot of it is not public.”
The rise of home security systems like Amazon’s Ring camera have raised serious questions about privacy, and Milgram weighed in on the issue. Below is an excerpt for that conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity.

      <title>How 5G and edge computing fit into the future of Intel’s traditionally chip-focused lineup</title>
      <description>Intel is one of the biggest names in the tech world, with chips that quite literally are the brains behind most of the computers and servers that we use every day. But the world of computers is expanding and Intel is changing, too, with a focus on both edge computing that puts processing resources in the cloud and the power that’s available directly on the physical device. 
And at the head of that is Dr. Venkata (Murthy) Renduchintala, the chief engineering officer and group president of the Technology, Systems Architecture and Client Group at Intel. Renduchintala joined Intel in 2016, having previously headed up competitor Qualcomm’s chip business. 
Renduchintala is the person in charge of almost all of Intel’s hardware, from design to engineering to manufacturing. He joined Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel and news editor Chaim Gartenberg for an interview episode of The Vergecast this week to discuss the present and future of Intel, including the company’s place in the development of 5G, the changing landscape of personal- and cloud-based computing, and what the next-generation of processors could look like.

      <title>Neil Young says the Macbook Pro has “Fisher-Price” audio quality</title>
      <description>Musician Neil Young and tech executive Phil Baker have been trying to push the tech industry to make it easier for consumers to listen to high-quality audio for almost a decade now. The duo’s hi-res music player Pono aimed to fix problems they said plagued MP3 players like the iPod and music software like iTunes — like compressed, lossy, and low-fidelity audio files that were not similar enough to their original recordings.
But five years after the Pono was released, Young believes the tech industry has still not advanced enough for consumers to easily listen to high resolution audio. The two men’s new book, To Feel the Music: A Songwriter’s Mission To Save High Quality Audio, details the hurdles they had to overcome to create the Pono, as well as what the tech industry should do in order to get consumers to realize what their missing with streaming and “CD-quality” music.
In an interview with The Vergecast, Young tells Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel that even though Grammy-winning artists are able to make music almost anywhere they go on their laptop or mobile devices, they’re still sacrificing on audio fidelity.

      <title>Pirate Radio » The PIRATE Act</title>
      <description>Congress is in the process of passing a non-partisan bill to increase support for enforcement against illegal pirate radio operations: Fines can now go as high as $2 million, and the FCC will fund “enforcement sweeps” in major radio markets. Does this target well-intentioned community radio, designed to speak to immigrant communities?
Episode three of The Verge's Pirate Radio mini-series featuring Bijan Stephen.

      <title>How America gave up on free markets with Thomas Philippon</title>
      <description>On this week’s Vergecast interview, Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel talks to finance professor and an economist at the NYU stern school of business Thomas Philippon. Thomas just wrote a book called The Great Reversal: How America Gave Up on Free Markets all about competition and consolidation in different markets.
When Thomas moved to the United States from France in the 90s, he noticed everything from laptops to internet access was cheaper in America, but over time has gotten more and more expensive. In the interview Nilay and Thomas discuss why that is — unsurprisingly the answer is consolidation in a lot of our markets.
Thomas makes a point that in some places, concentrations are actually good and creates value for the consumers, but in some markets like healthcare, technology, and airtravel, that consolidation has resulted in way higher prices for Americans. Since the prices go up slowly, we don’t actually notice.
If you have been listening to The Vergecast and been paying attention to our big conversations about whether or not we should be breaking up big tech companies, whether we should regulate them, or whether tech companies with network effects like Google and Facebook are different than companies like AT&amp;T and GE, this conversation is up your alley. Below is lightly edited except of the conversation.

      <title>What happened in the comments section of the FCC's net neutrality hearing?</title>
      <description>This week on The Vergecast, Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel talks with Jeremy Singer-Vine, the data editor for the BuzzFeed News investigative unit, about his story that was published recently regarding the fake comments on the Federal Communications Commission’s online net neutrality debate.
If you haven’t read the piece, you should. The investigation details where all of the fake comments in the FCC’s net neutrality process came from, including dead people leaving comments and shady political operatives involved in the scam.
It’s not really a story about net neutrality; rather, it’s about how systems designed for public participation in the government are so easily scammed, and what the challenges are for preventing such scams from happening.
Nilay and Jeremy discuss why it happened, how it happened, and what happens next if we want to use the internet to encourage open access participation in government without corruption.

      <description>This week for our interview series on The Vergecast, host and Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel talks to Gigi Sohn, a distinguished fellow at Georgetown Law’s Institute for Technology Law and Policy. We’ve had Gigi on the show before to talk about the ramifications following the repeal of net neutrality.
This time, we brought her back to talk about some recent developments in the tech policy world, including lawmakers in states like California introducing net neutrality bills.
We also talk to Gigi about the Sprint and T-Mobile merger and the issues surrounding how that merger will seemingly go through unless it’s stopped by a lawsuit from several states. Can Dish become a fourth mobile carrier?

      <title>Logitech's CEO Bracken Darrell on going beyond hardware</title>
      <description>This week on The Vergecast interview series, Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel speaks to current CEO of Logitech Bracken Darrell.
Logitech has acquired a couple of companies over the past few years, notably Blue Microphones and Ultimate Ears. Recently, Logitech acquired their first software company Streamlabs, a streaming software company used by almost half of all streamers on platforms like Twitch and YouTube.
Nilay and Bracken talk about how acquiring this software company makes sense for Logitech, its own hardware that works with Streamlabs, and what it’s like making hardware for big companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Google.

      <title>TechFreedom's Berin Szóka on bad tech policy</title>
      <description>This week on the Vergecast interview series, The Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel sits down with Berin Szóka, the president of TechFreedom. TechFreedom is a tech policy think tank based in Washington, DC that “digs deep into the hard policy and legal questions raised by technological change.”
Berin and Nilay have differed on a few issues regarding tech policy, like net neutrality, but what they do agree on is the state of the tech policy conversation — it’s bad. Szóka says Republicans he has previously worked with are now getting important topics like Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act wrong, and bad-faith politicians are misinterpreting it to try to score points and pass policy in their favor.
Hear Berin talk about what’s happening now with legislation like Sen. Josh Hawley’s platform moderation bills, why it’s weird for conservatives to want to directly regulate speech on the internet, and how this might play out in the future. Below is a lightly edited excerpt of the conversation.

      <title>Being hopeful about the web with Paul Ford</title>
      <description>This week on the interview episode of The Vergecast, editor of cheif of The Verge Nilay Patel sits down with CEO of Postlight Paul Ford. 
Paul Ford co-founded Postlight in 2015 and is a writer, product strategist, educator, programmer, and software consultant. 
If you read a lot of tech writing, you probably know Paul’s name. In 2015, Ford wrote an entire issue of Bloomberg’s Business Week titled “What is code?”  which colorfully explained how programming works on the web for people who don’t do it. Recently, he wrote a piece in Wired about how we should still be hopeful and excited about tech and what it can still do for us. 
Theres a lot of negative conversation about tech lately — regulating huge companies, what Facebook and Amazon are doing wrong — but from someone who builds things for the web, Paul brings an optimistic look at how tech can positively and creatively impact our lives in a fun and exciting way. 
Paul comes in to talk about his hopefulness, his piece in Wired, the state of building stuff for the web, and  how people think about tech today.

      <title>Silicon Valley’s Rep. Ro Khanna talks tech regulation</title>
      <description>On this week’s interview episode, Nilay is joined by Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) and Verge policy reporter Makena Kelly to discuss Congress’ plans to regulate Big Tech in the new year. Earlier this month, Democrats were able to take back a majority in the House of Representatives, and after blockbuster events this year like Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal, lawmakers are gearing up to rein in these Silicon Valley giants.
Khanna, who represents the California district that houses the Apple and Google campuses, was tasked with developing a set of principles these companies should abide by when it comes to issues like privacy, net neutrality, and anti-competitive behavior. He made the rounds, consulting with think tanks, the creator of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, and the tech companies themselves. From those discussions, Khanna was able to put forth a framework of 10 rights US citizens should have when they’re on the internet.
Khanna’s set of principles is called the “Internet Bill of Rights,” and with Democrats recapturing the House, tech leaders like Khanna have a chance to codify ideas like these into laws.

      <title>Ring CEO Jamie Siminoff wants to reduce neighborhood crime</title>
      <description>Ring began as a humble crowdfunded project called Doorbot — a Wi-Fi-enabled video doorbell that enabled two-way communication. In 2013, it was rejected on Shark Tank. This year, the company was acquired by Amazon for over $1 billion.

Nilay sat down with Ring CEO Jamie Siminoff on this week’s Vergecast to talk about joining the Amazon family of brands, the future of security in smart homes, and how Ring product owners may (or may not) work with law enforcement to make neighborhoods safer.

      <title>325: Chinese spy chips, Microsoft announcements, and Pixel 3 preview</title>
      <description>This week on The Vergecast, Nilay, Dieter, and Paul bring in experts to report on the top stories on the site this week. Reporter and host of Why’d You Push That Button Ashley Carman stops by the studio to explain the Bloomberg report detailing “Chinese spy chips” that may have been planted on servers from companies like Apple and Amazon. 

After that bizarre piece of news, senior editor Dan Seifert comes on the show to talk about the Microsoft hardware event he attended this week and the new products that were announced. 

We’ve also got a Google hardware event coming up next week, so they run through the leaks and rumors of gadgets that we might see. Check back next week for our full event coverage on this show. 

There’s a whole lot more in between all of that — including our favorite reoccurring segments from Liz Lopatto and Paul Miller — so listen to it all, and you’ll get it all. 

01:45 - What we still don’t know about the Facebook breach

2:48 - Chinese spy chips would be a ‘god-mode’ hack, experts say with Ashley Carman

29:18 - This week in Elon Musk with Liz Lopatto

33:37 - Microsoft Surface event 2018: the 5 biggest announcements with Dan Seifert

1:10:03 - Paul’s weekly segment “Type like nobody’s watching”

1:13:58 - New Google Pixel 3: the 8 most credible leaks

1:16:36 - LG V40 Review: one phone, five cameras

1:19:28 - iPhone XS: Why It’s A Whole New Camera – Halide

Also, in case you missed it, Nilay talked to Meredith Rose from Public Knowledge about the Music Modernization Act. You can listen to that along with this episode right in the Vergecast feed.

      <title>Public Knowledge’s Meredith Rose explains the Music Modernization Act</title>
      <description>The Music Modernization Act has passed Congress and now sits on President Trump’s desk, awaiting his signature. The bill is years in the making, a much needed solution to the complicated collision of music streaming services, licensing issues, and copyright law. For this week’s interview episode of The Vergecast, Nilay sat down with Meredith Rose, Policy Counsel at Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group. They talked about how the Music Modernization Act will help artists get paid, companies license music, and how new streaming services might compete with giants like Spotify.

      <title>324: Instagram chaos, Photokina 2018, and Elon Musk gets sued</title>
      <description>This week, we saw the two founders of Instagram abruptly leave, so Casey Newton comes on the show to talk about all that drama and what it might mean for Facebook’s prized possession.

Then, Dan Seifert joins us to talk about all of the cameras that were announced at Photokina this year, plus all the models that were announced before the show even started.

Finally, Liz Lopatto comes on for an impromptu This Week In Elon to discuss the fact that the SEC has filed a lawsuit against Mr. Musk, which happened just before we started recording the show.

1:28 - Instagram founders resign from Facebook

5:00 - 5 times Facebook messed with Instagram

20:43 - Whats App co-founder Forbes interview

22:32 - Former boss of Facebook Messenger calls Brian Acton “low class”

32:31 - Photokina 2018 recap

38:39 - Zeiss camera with built-in Adobe Lightroom

51:16 - Paul’s weekly segment “Space Egg”

56:07 - This week in Elon Musk: Live Edition™ with Liz Lopatto

1:09:52 - Oculus Quest

Also, in case you missed it, Nilay talked to Google AMP’s Malte Ubl about how he’s trying to make the mobile web better. You can listen to that in the Vergecast feed.

      <title>Google AMP’s Malte Ubl wants to make the mobile web better</title>
      <description>You may not have heard of Google AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) but you almost certainly have used it. The Google open-source project has been making waves since it launched in 2016 in an effort to make the mobile web faster to load and smoother to navigate. This week, Nilay sat down with Malte Ubl, creator and tech lead of AMP, to talk about the controversy of bifurcating the web, forming a technical steering committee to co-lead the project, and Ubl’s vision for the future of the mobile web.

In the second half of the show, the crew updates us on what to expect for next week’s Apple event, from the mysterious third phone to the updated AirPods rumors. 

There’s a whole lot in between that — like a whole section dedicated to Roombas — so listen to it all, and you’ll get it all.

30:39 - The 9 most plausible rumors about the new iPhones

35:28 - Pixel 3 XL found in a Lyft, had already leaked enough for driver to recognize it

37:39 - New 6.5-inch iPhone X model reportedly called the ‘iPhone XS Max’

38:25 - Third-party USB-C to Lightning cables are reportedly happening

42:41 - Five things to expect at the Apple event next week

45:16 - Paul’s weekly segment “The decline of dirt”

50:59 - Google’s Pixel 3 event will take place on October 9th

51:53 - BMW is the latest automaker to introduce its own in-car voice assistant

52:04 - Netflix and YouTube are most throttled mobile apps by US carriers, new study says

      <title>Tim Wu thinks it’s time to break up Facebook</title>
      <description>Best known for coining the phrase “net neutrality” and his book The Master Switch, Tim Wu has a new book coming out in November called The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age. In it, he argues compellingly for a return to aggressive antitrust enforcement in the style of Teddy Roosevelt, saying that Google, Facebook, Amazon, and other huge tech companies are a threat to democracy as they get bigger and bigger.

Nilay sits down with Wu for this week's interview episode of The Vergecast.

      <title>App Store chaos, ray tracing, and new Macbook Air rumors</title>
      <description>This week on The Vergecast, Paul, Nilay, and Dieter start off the show with the news that Netflix is testing a payment feature to bypass Apple’s App Store fees, which leads into a larger discussion of (as Nilay calls it) “App Store chaos.” 

Paul seems pretty excited about “ray tracing” — a term that Nvidia is using for its upcoming graphics cards — so the crew explains what that means and how far ahead Nvidia is compared to its competition.

Competition is a general theme in this week’s episode. 

We’ve also got our two recurring segments in the show: deputy editor Liz Lopatto’s “This Week in Elon Musk” (which is now a newsletter) and Paul’s segment “Cold ears, warm heart.” 

And we must not forget the latest Apple rumors that have hit the news in preparation for the likely Apple event in September. 

But there’s a whole lot more in between that, so listen to it all and you’ll get it all. 

03:35 - Netflix is testing a payment feature to bypass Apple’s App Store fees

20:39 - ‘Ray tracing’ could bring the biggest graphics jump in a decade

30:59 - DJI’s new Mavic 2 drones have upgraded cameras and zoom lenses

34:34 - Nikon strikes back at Sony with first full-frame mirrorless cameras

40:09 - This week in Elon Musk with Liz Lopatto

44:15 - Apple’s MacBook Air successor will reportedly have slim bezels and high-res Retina display

51:14 - Microsoft to bundle Xbox One consoles, Xbox Live, and Game Pass into a monthly subscription service

52:56 - Paul’s weekly segment “Cold ears, warm heart”

53:52 - A day in the life of a Waymo self-driving taxi

        <![CDATA[<p>This week on The Vergecast, Paul, Nilay, and Dieter start off the show with the news that Netflix is testing a payment feature to bypass Apple’s App Store fees, which leads into a larger discussion of (as Nilay calls it) “App Store chaos.” 

Paul seems pretty excited about “ray tracing” — a term that Nvidia is using for its upcoming graphics cards — so the crew explains what that means and how far ahead Nvidia is compared to its competition.

Competition is a general theme in this week’s episode. 

We’ve also got our two recurring segments in the show: deputy editor Liz Lopatto’s “This Week in Elon Musk” (which is now a newsletter) and Paul’s segment “Cold ears, warm heart.” 

And we must not forget the latest Apple rumors that have hit the news in preparation for the likely Apple event in September. 

But there’s a whole lot more in between that, so listen to it all and you’ll get it all.

We’ve also got two fresh segments this this week. Deputy Editor Liz Lopatto updates us on this week in Elon Musk, and culture reporters Megan Farokhmanesh and Bijan Stephen stop by to tell us what’s happening in culture section of The Verge.

09:58 - Android 9 Pie review

      <title>Magic Leap, Galaxy Note 9, and Android Pie </title>
      <description>If you’ve been reading The Verge this week, then you know Samsung announced a few products. We got our hands on the Galaxy Note 9, the Galaxy Watch, and we even got to look at that Home speaker as well. That news is covered in a big chunk of The Vergecast this week, but there was also so much other stuff that happened. 

Adi Robertson was able to travel down to Plantation, Florida, to check out Magic Leap’s creator edition headset. She sits down with Nilay, Paul, and Dieter to discuss her experience with the device and how it compares to the years of hype surrounding it. 

And, of course, since another week went by on this planet, there is another week of Elon Musk news. Science editor Liz Lopatto graciously fills us in on the show. 

Like I said, there’s a whole lot more — like Paul’s weekly segment SHAASUIVG — so if you listen to it all, you’ll get it all really. 

03:32 - Samsung announces Galaxy Note 9 with bigger screen, huge battery, and more powerful S Pen

16:20 - Fortnite for Android is launching today exclusively on recent Samsung Galaxy devices

23:47 - Samsung unveils its latest smartwatch — the Galaxy Watch

24:27 - Samsung announces Galaxy Home speaker

25:49 - Samsung is partnering with Spotify across its devices

29:20 - The 5 most important Android Pie updates

32:57 - I tried Magic Leap and saw a flawed glimpse of mixed reality’s amazing potential

54:25 - This week in Elon Musk with Liz Lopatto 

58:33 - Microsoft Surface Go review: a little goes a long way

1:03:03 - The new Anki Vector robot is smart enough to just hang out

1:08:35 - The FCC lied to Congress about an alleged cyberattack and didn’t come clean until now

1:12:00 - Justice Department appeal says AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger decision is ‘contrary to fundamental economic logic’

1:14:48 - Paul’s weekly segment “SHAASUIVG”

1:17:24 - Google Pixel 3 XL leak appears to show production hardware and wired USB-C Pixel Buds

1:18:09 - The Palm smartphone reboot is shaping up to be disappointing

      <title>Surface Go, Apple earnings, and HipChat memories</title>
      <description>In the thrilling conclusion to our three part epic miniseries, "Apple doesn't make the laptops we want," Nilay, Paul, and Dieter discuss how nothing really even matters because Apple is a phone company worth $1 trillion.

Samsung, Amazon, and Tesla earnings are also discussed, along with Farhad Manjoo's "Frightful Five" thesis.

Then, in "The Bezel Wars," our hosts discuss the Surface Go, iPad rumors, and the Windows 10 S life Dieter has been living.

Paul's weekly segment about "Wireless Vapes" is as poignant as ever.

Ultimately, the final question is something like, "How many notches can you fit on the blockchain?"




02:19 - The race to $1 trillion

05:25 - Phones, not Macs

14:18 - Amazon's cloud power

24:53 - Dieter's Surface Go impressions

26:41 - Can you name ten Windows 10 S apps?

34:20 - #donglelife

38:44 - Paul's weekly segment, "Wireless Vapes"

44:35 - Two notches, max

46:31 - Pixel 3 leak

47:54 - Mergers and acquisitions

      <title>Macbook Pro review, Lenovo smart display review, and the Data Transfer Project</title>
      <description>After a week of speculation on whether the new MacBook Pro was throttling performance under heat, Apple released a software fix to address the problem. Dieter’s review for the laptop (post software fix) published on Wednesday so Nilay, Paul, and Dieter discuss what happened with the product and how it performs. 

Dieter also reviewed the new Lenovo Smart Display, so there's a chunk of the show dedicated to that device, which exceeded expectations. 

And we’ve got another week of Elon Musk. Transportation reporter Andrew Hawkins gives us an update in what has been happening in the world of Tesla, SpaceX, and the various endeavors of the unpredictable billionaire. 

We’re going strong with our weekly interviews, and this week we have Brian Willard from Google to discuss the Data Transfer Project — Google’s initiative designed to transfer data from one service to another without downloading and re-uploading. 

We also can’t forget the segment Paul does every week called “What is it like to be a dolphin?” so keep listening for that.

But you know, we’ve got a whole lot more in between that — so listen to it all and you’ll get it all. 

02:30 - Apple MacBook Pro review (2018, 15-inch): the heat is on

22:01 - This week in Elon Musk with Andrew Hawkins 

26:53 - Lenovo Smart Display review

35:44 - Data Transfer Project with Brian Willard of Google

59:46 - Paul’s weekly segment “What is it like to be a dolphin?”

1:02:30 - Amazon’s Alexa Cast makes it simpler to play music from your phone on Echo speakers

1:10:00 - Facebook growth slows in aftermath of privacy scandals

        <![CDATA[<p>After a week of speculation on whether the new MacBook Pro was throttling performance under heat, Apple released a software fix to address the problem. Dieter’s review for the laptop (post software fix) published on Wednesday so Nilay, Paul, and Dieter discuss what happened with the product and how it performs. 

Dieter also reviewed the new Lenovo Smart Display, so there's a chunk of the show dedicated to that device, which exceeded expectations. 

And we’ve got another week of Elon Musk. Transportation reporter Andrew Hawkins gives us an update in what has been happening in the world of Tesla, SpaceX, and the various endeavors of the unpredictable billionaire. 

We’re going strong with our weekly interviews, and this week we have Brian Willard from Google to discuss the Data Transfer Project — Google’s initiative designed to transfer data from one service to another without downloading and re-uploading. 

We also can’t forget the segment Paul does every week called “What is it like to be a dolphin?” so keep listening for that.

But you know, we’ve got a whole lot more in between that — so listen to it all and you’ll get it all. 

02:30 - Apple MacBook Pro review (2018, 15-inch): the heat is on

      <title>Google gets fined, Macbook Pro benchmarks, and Roku CEO Anthony Wood</title>
      <description>We’ve got a super stuffed episode of The Vergecast this week.

First, the biggest news in tech right now is the European Commission’s ruling that Google has been unfairly using Android to push Google search on users, giving it an unfair advantage. Nilay, Dieter, and Paul sit down and discuss the implications.

In the second half of the show, Dieter discusses some of the new MacBook Pro benchmarks that claim the processors may throttle performance due to cooling issues.

Nilay got an exclusive interview with Roku CEO Anthony Wood, so we’ve included that in this episode as well.

Also, our culture coverage continues this week with another roundup by Megan Farokhmanesh and Bijan Stephen.

There’s even a whole lot more in between that — like Paul’s newly sponsored segment “Fold the phone” — so listen to it all, and you’ll get it all.

01:46 - Verizon is shutting down its original video app Go90

06:26 - Six questions you were afraid to ask about Google’s EU antitrust case

25:09 - Google may put its Fuchsia OS on smart home devices within three years

34:25 - This week in culture with Megan and Bijan

39:42 - Test suggests 2018 MacBook Pro can’t keep up with Intel Core i9 chip’s thermal demands

53:15 - Roku CEO Anthony Wood interview

1:17:33 - Paul’s weekly segment “Fold the phone”

1:20:39 - Galaxy Note 9 leak suggests it looks a lot like the Note 8

1:22:12 - Walmart reportedly plans to launch Netflix competitor under its Vudu brand later this year

      <title>macOS Mojave beta, Microsoft Surface USB-C dongle, and this week in Elon Musk</title>
      <description>The Vergecast starts off this week in a traditional fashion with a talk about dongles — Microsoft’s $80 USB-C dongle to be exact. But there’s a whole bunch of little things that also happened this week that Nilay, Dieter, and Paul discuss. We’ve got Apple acknowledging the problem with its MacBook keyboards, Google demoing Duplex, and Apple releasing the Mojave public beta.

Also this week, we bring you two new rotating segments on the show. First we have transportation reporter Sean O’Kane with “This Week in Elon Musk” — a rundown of the news that happened this week in the Elon Musk canon. Second, culture reporters Megan Farokhmanesh and Bijan Stephen run though their favorite “Culture Headlines” on The Verge this week.

And of course we’ve got Paul’s weekly segment that he does every week, “Rhymes With What’s Poppin’,” so if you listen to the whole show, you’ve got a stew going.

02:20 - Microsoft’s Surface USB-C dongle launches on June 29th for $79.99

09:15 - Apple acknowledges faulty MacBook and MacBook Pro keyboards with new repair program

15:00 - macOS Mojave is now available in public beta

20:59 - Intel now faces a fight for its future

29:06 - This week in Elon Musk with Sean O’Kane

33:41 - Google Duplex really works and testing begins this summer

42:03 - BlackBerry Key2 review: a keyboard with a phone

42:59 - LG says screw everything, we’re doing five cameras for the V40

43:57 - The Galaxy Note 9 hits the FCC, with launch of Samsung’s next flagship presumably on the horizon

45:51 - AT&amp;T more than doubles ‘admin fee’ for every wireless customer

48:31 - Culture headlines with Megan and Bijan

52:58 - Honda retires its famed Asimo robot

53:41 - Paul’s weekly segment “Rhymes with whats poppin”

55:58 - Amazon adds voice control to its Alexa iOS app

      <title>Recode's Kara Swisher,  AT&amp;T - Time Warner, and IGTV</title>
      <description>Instagram announced on Wednesday a standalone app called IGTV, a place for watching long-form vertical video. Casey and Ashely —  who went to Instagram’s event that announced the app — talk with Nilay, Dieter, and Paul about their initial feelings about the platform and predict how it will fit into the social mediasphere. 

Also, Nilay Patel sits down with Kara Swisher to talk about the recent AT&amp;T and Time Warner merger. Kara published a book in 2003 about the AOL and Time Warner merger There Must Be a Pony in Here Somewhere (the merger split off in 2009) so the two discuss the similarities and differences between the two mergers and what they can potentially mean when distribution companies own content. 

There’s a whole lot more in between that — like Paul’s weekly segment (now up for sale) “Shaavoop” — so listen to it all and you’ll get it all. 

01:54 - Instagram announces IGTV, a standalone app for longer videos

19:33 - AT&amp;T launches new WatchTV streaming service at aggressive $15-per-month price

27:26 - Tinder parent company buys anti-Tinder dating app Hinge

        <![CDATA[<p>Instagram announced on Wednesday a standalone app called IGTV, a place for watching long-form vertical video. Casey and Ashely —  who went to Instagram’s event that announced the app — talk with Nilay, Dieter, and Paul about their initial feelings about the platform and predict how it will fit into the social mediasphere. 

Also, Nilay Patel sits down with Kara Swisher to talk about the recent AT&amp;T and Time Warner merger. Kara published a book in 2003 about the AOL and Time Warner merger There Must Be a Pony in Here Somewhere (the merger split off in 2009) so the two discuss the similarities and differences between the two mergers and what they can potentially mean when distribution companies own content. 

There’s a whole lot more in between that — like Paul’s weekly segment (now up for sale) “Shaavoop” — so listen to it all and you’ll get it all.

      <title>Sonos CEO Patrick Spence, E3, and net neutrality ends</title>
      <description>In addition to our classic Nilay, Dieter, and Paul trio, we’ve added a few things this week.

To give you the best coverage of E3, culture editor Laura Hudson gives us a quick rundown of the news from the expo to start off the show

In the second half of the show, Nilay sits down with Sonos CEO Patrick Spence. 

Don’t worry, there’s plenty of other classic Vergecast — some gadget talk, Paul’s weekly segment (you know, “How big is the Moon?”), and some deep dives into net neutrality, antitrust law, and Comcast’s $65 million bid on 21st Century Fox.

07:13 - Sony issues weak response to Fortnite cross-play controversy on PS4 and Switch

11:26 - Microsoft is getting ready for the next Xbox vs. PlayStation console war

16:33 - Joseph Gordon-Levitt is defending a controversial plan to crowdsource Beyond Good and Evil 2 art

25:01 - Interview with CEO of Sonos Patrick Spence

1:02:49 - Paul’s weekly segment “How big is the moon?”

1:06:28 - I picked up a Boring Company Not-A-Flamethrower and it’s mine now

1:07:04 - The Boring Company’s Chicago project seems awfully cheap for something so big

1:11:18 - HTC U12 Plus review: fixing what didn’t need to be broken

1:12:54 - Samsung upgrades the Chromebook Plus with a second camera and new processor

1:13:44 - Eero promises not to brick routers if you don’t pay a subscription

1:17:47 - Net neutrality is dead — what now?

1:19:48 - Comcast makes $65 billion offer to steal 21st Century Fox away from Disney

      <title>Code Conference, Pixel 3 rumors, and WWDC preview</title>
      <description>The Vergecast is here once again to fulfill the weekly prophecy of illuminating tech news. This week, Dieter is at Recode’s Code Conference, but he still calls in to talk to Nilay, Natt, and Paul about what he saw and heard. 

Also, Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference is next week, so the crew runs through what to expect. 

There’s a whole lot in between that — like Paul’s weekly segment “Embarrassingly parallel,” rumors about the next Pixel phone, and some deep philosophy about whether a phone is a tool or an instrument — so listen to it all, and you’ll get it all. 

00:41 - Code Conference 2018

11:56 - AT&amp;T and Verizon both want to run massive ad-tracking networks to rival Facebook

27:31 - Apple’s AirPlay 2 with multiroom audio streaming and stereo

37:41 - Paul’s weekly segment “Embarrassingly parallel”

40:24 - Cryptocurrency mining rigs are just PCs — so why won’t Stripe let you sell them?

      <title>Elon Musk, Red Hydrogen, and Zuckerberg in the EU</title>
      <description>Are you driving somewhere for the holiday weekend? Here at _The Verge_ we'd like to encourage you to use a car that's wholly or at least primarily powered by dirty fossil fuels. On this week's episode of _The Vergecast_, Nilay, Natt, Casey, and Paul discuss how we're financially beholden to Big Car, and what to do about it now that Elon Musk has called us out on our bias.

We also got a chance to discuss Nilay's insane theory about Apple's dongle suppression campaign, Mark Zuckerberg's wacky trip to the EU, and spoke with unearned confidence about Dieter's hands-on with the Red Hydrogen One. Paul's weekly report on robots that do backflips is, of course, also something that happened.

01:50 - Elon Musk

27:54 - Red Hydrogen One hands-on

32:34 - RIP Essential?

36:37 - BlackBerry KEY2

41:19 - Dongle suppression EXPOSED

47:15 - Paul’s weekly segment “Robot backflip weekly update”

51:08 - GDPR is happening

55:54 - Mark Zuckerberg in the EU

1:03:51 - Casey shamelessly plugs Converge

1:06:35 - What’s happening in the rest of tech

We also got a chance to discuss Nilay's insane theory about Apple's dongle suppression campaign, Mark Zuckerberg's wacky trip to the EU, and spoke with unearned confidence about Dieter's hands-on with the Red Hydrogen One. Paul's weekly report on robots that do backflips is, of course, also something that happened.

01:50 - Elon Musk

27:54 - Red Hydrogen One hands-on

32:34 - RIP Essential?

36:37 - BlackBerry KEY2

41:19 - Dongle suppression EXPOSED

47:15 - Paul’s weekly segment “Robot backflip weekly update”

51:08 - GDPR is happening

55:54 - Mark Zuckerberg in the EU

1:03:51 - Casey shamelessly plugs Converge

1:06:35 - What’s happening in the rest of tech</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices. Visit <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a></p>]]>

      <title>The Selfish Ledger, YouTube Premium, and One Plus 6</title>
      <description>The Vergecast trio comes together this week to discuss an internal Google video that was obtained by The Verge titled “the Selfish Ledger.” That topic takes up a good chunk of the show, but there’s a lot more after that.

Nilay, Paul, and Dieter jump into other Google-related topics, like what’s happening to YouTube Red, Google Duplex theories, and a list of gadget news.

They were able to fit in Paul’s weekly segment he does every week “Don’t block my chain,” so if you listen to it all, you’ll get it all. 

04:04 - Google’s Selfish Ledger is an unsettling vision of Silicon Valley social engineering

19:02 - Apple Watch behavioral science 

19:47 - Google Duplex demo, or say whether the calls were edited

23:56 - Google Chrome is removing the secure indicator from HTTPS sites in September

28:12 - Entire Nest ecosystem of smart home devices goes offline 

30:16 - YouTube Music and YouTube Premium announced as YouTube Red replacement

39:28 - OnePlus 6 announced with a glass back and a notched 6.3-inch display

41:42 - The RED Hydrogen One is coming to AT&amp;T and Verizon this summer

44:16 - Onkyo’s receivers will work with Sonos, thanks to upcoming June firmware update

46:33 - A new Wi-Fi standard could let different mesh routers work together

48:41 - Paul’s weekly segment “Don’t block my chain”

52:46 - Microsoft’s Surface Hub 2 is designed for an office of the future

53:29 - Microsoft reportedly working on $400 Surface tablets to compete with the iPad

53:44 - The desktop belongs to Electron

1:01:38 - Uber CEO: our future won’t just be cars

        <![CDATA[<p>This week on The Vergecast, Dieter, Natt, and Paul are still without Nilay but there’s a whole lot to talk about. 

Google made some changes with Gmail — which is now live, and Snap surprised us this week with their new edition of Spectacles — but what makes them different from the original model? 

Also, there’s a whole bunch of Amazon news and rumors this week, including an Echo Dot for your child.

There’s even a whole lot more in between that — like the segment Paul does every week (say it with me) “I’ve carved this for you out of aluminum” — so listen if you listen to this whole episode of The Vergecast, you’ll be all up to date with the tech news of the week and won’t have to worry about much else the rest of your weekend. 

01:20 - Gmail’s biggest redesign is now live

09:49 - Google is finally making a standalone Tasks app

16:38 - Snap’s second-generation Spectacles are more grown up — and more expensive

28:05 - Amazon will now deliver packages to the trunk of your car

32:33 - Amazon’s new Echo Dot Kids Edition comes with a colorful case and parental controls

37:04 - Amazon is reportedly working on its first home robot 

40:29 - Amazon teases upcoming Fire TV Cube

43:41 - Paul’s weekly segment “I’ve carved this for you out of aluminum”

      <title>Chat for Android, Nintendo Labo, and Motorola (like a) G6</title>
      <description>It was a slow week until Google decided to attempt another fix for Android messaging and Nintendo made the entire staff fall in love with cardboard. Nilay’s still on paternity leave, but Dieter and Paul are joined again by Technology Editor Natt Garun to explain it all.

We also jumped on the hot-button issues like the Russian ban of Telegram and how Alexa Skill Blueprints aren’t Turing complete. And, of course, Paul’s weekly segment “Ring-a-ding-ding” has all the insightful Bluetooth MIDI accessory commentary you crave.

1:20 - Chat for Android

20:48 - Telegram

29:22 - Nintendo Labo

37:41 - Amazon Skill Blueprints

41:09 - Motorola G6

43:44 - Paul’s Weekly Segment "Ring-a-ding-ding"

46:39 - New free Spotify

48:51 - RIP vaunt

      <description>It is episode 300 of The Vergecast! To celebrate, Nilay, Dieter, and Paul start the show by explaining inside jokes that have been stamped into the show over the past few years.

Also, there’s some news that came out this week. We have an iPad review, some Mark Zuckerberg updates, and a little bit of Apple drama. 

There’s a lot more in between that — like Paul’s segment he does every week with the same name “Lonely Alone” — so listen to it all, and you’ll get it all.

      <title>New iPads, Microsoft reorg, and Europe's new privacy rule</title>
      <description>We’ve got a bunch of tech luminaries on The Vergecast this week to help us understand the week in tech news.

Nilay, Dieter, and Paul welcome Lauren Goode back to the show for her last week at The Verge to discuss the new iPads that Apple released this past Tuesday. Lauren and Dieter went to Chicago for the event, so they share their experience and insight on the new products and their relationship with the education field.

After that, the crew bring in senior reporter Russell Brandom to help us understand how Europe’s new privacy rule is reshaping the internet.

And finally, senior editor Tom Warren returns to the show to share his expertise with Microsoft and break down Microsoft’s announcement of the reorganization of their company.

There’s a whole lot more in between all of that — like Paul’s weekly segment “The little robot that could” — so listen to it all and you’ll get it all.

03:12 - The 5 biggest announcements from the Apple education event

32:18 - How Europe’s new privacy rule is reshaping the internet

51:17 - Paul’s weekly segment “The little robot that could”

53:12 - Microsoft is ready for a world beyond Windows

Also, Dieter got an exclusive look at Intel’s new smart glasses, and Nilay reviewed Apple’s HomePod, so they share their experiences with the technology and discuss what it means for the rest of the market.

      <title>CES 2018: Robots, TVs, and virtual assistants </title>
      <description>The Verge crew is on our way back home after a week at the Consumer Electronics Show 2018. This week, we did a ton of reporting, a ton of videos, and four live Circuit Breaker shows, so we did not have a lot of time to sit down and tape a full-length Vergecast. But what we did do was collect a bunch of audio recorded throughout the show — including clips from Circuit Breaker Live — to give you an idea of what it’s like to be at CES, and what kinds of things we saw this year.

Enjoy, and we’ll see you next week.

      <title>Meltdown and Spectre will kill us all</title>
      <description>CES is next week, and we'll get to it, but first we need to talk to security expert Russell Brandom to make sure we won't all be dead from CPU security vulnerabilities before then. Also, stay tuned for Paul Miller's excellent and enlightening sci-fi short story allegory for how Meltdown actually works. He did a great job.

Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn, the world's foremost experts on what to expect from the world's most important technology tradeshow, make their CES predictions, and Paul does his weekly segment "Mustard, back off!" So wow, what a great episode. Sorry about the sad stuff where computers are fundamentally flawed and nothing is safe.

2:56 - Meltdown and Spectre

      <title>Magic Leap, iPhones slow down, and Microsoft removes Chrome installer from Windows Store</title>
      <description>Hello! And happy holidays. This is the last Vergecast of 2017! But we go out with a bang (At least two computers broke down during this recording). The two big things that happened this week was the unveiling of the mysterious Magic Leap augmented reality goggles and Apple confirming they slow down older iPhones. So Nilay, Dieter, and Paul welcome senior reporter Adi Robertson back to the show, who has been reporting on Magic Leap for the past few years. 

There’s a whole lot more in between that, like Paul’s weekly segment “Robots teach me how to breathe?” so listen to it all and you’ll get it all. 

01:41 - Magic Leap finally unveils augmented reality goggles

31:39 - Apple confirms iPhones with older batteries will take hits in performance

50:13 - Paul’s weekly segment “Robots teach me how to breathe?”

52:45 - Google brings Chrome to the Windows Store as just a download link

57:29 - Caavo, the universal remote control that uses machine vision, will ship on February 14th

1:02:50 - Amazon Echo Spot review

      <title>FCC kills net neutrality, the iMac Pro arrives, and T-Mobile buys Layer3 TV</title>
      <description>The Vergecast three-piece is back together, with Nilay leading the flagship podcast. The biggest news this week is something we’ve seen coming for a while: on Thursday, the FCC voted to repeal net neutrality rules. Nilay, Dieter, and Paul sit down to discuss the action and their viewpoints on what this means going forward for the internet. 

Also, the iMac Pro is now available to order and Dieter got to write about it. There’s quite a bit of talk about whether this computer is worth the price for its power. 

There’s a lot more in between that — like Paul’s weekly segment “The internet of claps” — so listen to the whole episode to get everything to need to know in the world of tech this week. 

02:10 - The FCC just killed net neutrality

 41:53 - The iMac Pro is a beast, but it’s not for everybody

57:23 - What is Layer3 TV and why is T-Mobile buying it?

1:04:16 - Paul’s weekly segment “The internet of claps”

      <title>ARM powered PCs, Google  vs Amazon, and Messenger Kids</title>
      <description>This week, Dieter Bohn runs the show with Paul Miller and Natt Garun, and it's been a wild week of news. Amazon and Google are basically feuding right now: Google is pulling YouTube from the FireTV so the podcast trio ponders what this frightening predicament means for the streaming and the open web. Also, Microsoft launched some ARM-powered Windows 10 PCs, so you bet these tech luminaries are going to talk about it.

There’s lots more in between that, like Paul’s weekly segment (say it with me) “Color me surprised,” so listen to it all and you’ll get it all.

05:00 - Microsoft launches ARM-powered Windows 10 PCs with ‘all-day’ battery life

17:44 - Qualcomm announces the Snapdragon 845 processor

22:40 - How Messenger Kids takes more from families than it gives them

30:17 - Google and Amazon are punishing their own customers in a bitter feud

40:27 - DeepMind’s AI became a superhuman chess player in a few hours, just for fun 

44:21 - Major airlines are about to ban ‘smart luggage’

49:45 - Paul’s weekly segment “Color me surprised”

52:06 - Instagram is testing Direct, a standalone messaging app that replaces the current inbox

54:57 - Apple's had a shockingly bad week of software problems

1:00:22 - Bitcoin hits $15,000

1:04:01 - CryptoKitties

Also, Microsoft launched some ARM-powered Windows 10 PCs, so you bet these tech luminaries are going to talk about it.

There’s lots more in between that, like Paul’s weekly segment (say it with me) “Color me surprised,” so listen to it all and you’ll get it all.

05:00 - Microsoft launches ARM-powered Windows 10 PCs with ‘all-day’ battery life

17:44 - Qualcomm announces the Snapdragon 845 processor

22:40 - How Messenger Kids takes more from families than it gives them

30:17 - Google and Amazon are punishing their own customers in a bitter feud

40:27 - DeepMind’s AI became a superhuman chess player in a few hours, just for fun 

44:21 - Major airlines are about to ban ‘smart luggage’

49:45 - Paul’s weekly segment “Color me surprised”

52:06 - Instagram is testing Direct, a standalone messaging app that replaces the current inbox

54:57 - Apple's had a shockingly bad week of software problems

      <title>iPhone X Review</title>
      <description>The iPhone X is finally here. Nilay had the chance to review it, so, along with Paul, Ashley, and Dan, he discusses what it’s like to use the phone in the real world as well as what the process of reviewing it was like.

We also welcome Phil Esposito, The Verge’s lead video director, to the show for the first time to discuss the roller coaster that is working on the two videos we produced throughout the week.

There’s a whole lot in between that — like Paul’s weekly segment about a robot dog — so listen to it all and you’ll get it all.

03:22 - iPhone X first impressions 

24:33 - iPhone X review with Phil Esposito

      <itunes:summary>The iPhone X is finally here. Nilay had the chance to review it, so, along with Paul, Ashley, and Dan, he discusses what it’s like to use the phone in the real world as well as what the process of reviewing it was like.

We also welcome Phil Esposito, The Verge’s lead video director, to the show for the first time to discuss the roller coaster that is working on the two videos we produced throughout the week.

There’s a whole lot in between that — like Paul’s weekly segment about a robot dog — so listen to it all and you’ll get it all.

      <title>Pixel 2 review, KRACK, and Microsoft's Surface Book sequel</title>
      <description>The reviews are in and everybody just loves the quality OLED component Google picked for the Pixel 2 XL. Really just can't stop talking about it. And talking?

On this episode Nilay, Paul, and Dieter discuss the reviews of Google's new phones, and The Verge's security expert Russell Brandom drops by to explain KRACK and four-way handshakes. It's all the grit and off-axis color shifting of a Pentile display, in podcast form.

10:27 Smartphone screens, display

17:58 Features, camera, speaker

26:12 Russell: Wi-Fi, WPA 2 protocol

      <title>Oculus Go, Movies Anywhere, and Windows Phone died again</title>
      <description>We’ve got a bloggy Vergecast today. In between review weeks, a few things popped up in the news that Nilay, Dieter, and Paul needed to talk about. Google is integrating video chat into a phone but still not text; you can now watch all the movies you’ve purchased online in one place; Apple is on a “hype cycle” talking about AR; and Windows Phone died again. 

But that’s not all. There’s a whole lot in between that — like the segment Paul does every week, “You know Dan, the duck face is no longer cool” — so listen to it all and you’ll get it all. 

07:28 - Android Messaging rant

18:49 - Hollywood studios join Disney to launch Movies Anywhere digital locker service

26:07 - Google will “permanently remove” Home Mini feature that led to constant recording

32:21 - Apple hype cycle 

38:02 - Oculus announces new $199 self-contained VR headset called Oculus Go 

49:59 - Windows Phone is dead

58:17 - Paul’s weekly segment “You know Dan, the duck face is no longer cool”

1:01:50 - Amazon finally makes a waterproof Kindle, after 10 years of Kindles

      <description>Another week, another tech event: on Wednesday, Google had its fall hardware event. Nilay, Paul, and Dieter try to fit everything they want to say into 90 minutes. Dieter had some exclusive looks at the products, and was able to talk to CEO Sundar Pichai and senior vice president of hardware Rick Osterloh, so the crew lets Dieter talk this week to get more of the details.

There’s a whole lot in between that — including everyone’s favorite segment “Micro is more mini than mini” — so listen to it all and you’ll get it all.

      <description>This week on The Vergecast, Nilay, Lauren, Dieter, and Paul begin by discussing the controversy over the Google engineer who was fired over writing a 10-page viral memo about diversity.

In the second half of the show, the crew runs through the latest leaks, releases, and controversies in the gadget world, including Paul’s segment he does every week, “FROYO PODS.” 

01:46 - Google engineer fired over memo files labor complaint

33:09 - Consumer Reports stops recommending Microsoft Surface PCs over reliability concerns

37:41 - The new iPhone could have a resizable home button and face recognition for payments

46:22 - 4K Apple TV with HDR spotted in HomePod firmware

48:54 - Essential promises a new phone release date 'in a week'

56:19 - Another Pixel 2 leak shows the phone’s large front bezels

58:14 - Paul’s weekly segment “FROYO PODS”

      <title>Tesla Model 3 first drive, iPhone leaks, and a bluetooth salt shaker</title>
      <description>We are without Nilay Patel on The Vergecast this week, so Dieter Bohn and Paul Miller step up to host with some very special guests: transportation editor Tamara Warren, and tech editor Natt Garun. Tamara was one of the few people who got to test drive the Tesla Model 3 last week, so she brings her expertise to the show to talk about what she knows so far.

Also, some of the iPhone’s design and features got leaked out from code in the HomePod, so Natt Garun helps the crew break down all the information we’ve gleaned.

There’s a whole lot in between that — like Paul’s segment about the salt shaker Smalt — so listen to it all and you’ll get it all.

01:18 - Tesla Model 3 first drive

31:02 - The next iPhone’s screen design and face unlock apparently confirmed by HomePod firmware

39:52 - This iPhone 8 concept video imagines a touchscreen in the home button

48:33 - Next Level final episode with Lauren Goode

1:10:56 - Paul’s weekly segment “Smalt you later”

1:14:25 - Apple returns to growth as cheaper iPads boost sales

1:15:32 - Fitbit says its long-awaited smartwatch will be ready for the holidays

Halfway through the show, senior tech editor Lauren Goode stops by to talk a little bit about her new video series Next Level, which shows the technology that’s being worked on at some of the world’s most innovative companies and research institutions. You can check out the first episode here. 

Last, but not least, we have what you’ve been waiting for — phone news! We have a mini Verge mobile show to discuss the deaths and births of the mobile world recently. 

There’s a whole lot in between that, so listen to it all and you’ll get it all. 

03:45 - A Microsoft font may have exposed corruption in Pakistan

07:39 - Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T want Congress to make a net neutrality law because they will write it

23:39 - The FCC says net neutrality destroys small ISPs. So has it? 

35:47 - Next Level with Lauren Goode

52:13 - iFixit teardown confirms Note 7 Fan Edition is just a Note 7 with a new, smaller battery 

53:30 - BlackBerry KeyOne launches on Sprint, the eternal harbor of innovation

54:25 - Death of Windows Phone

59:47 - The new Pixel XL 

1:01:54 - Luxury phone maker Vertu is shutting down its UK manufacturing operation

1:03:27 - Andy Rubin’s Essential is staying quiet on the Essential Phone delay

      <title>The iPhone turns 10, Petya ransomware and an iOS 11 preview</title>
      <description>Did you know it was the iPhone's 10th anniversary on Thursday? The Vergecast knows. Nilay, Dieter, and Paul talk about what the iPhone means to them, to the industry, and to the entire universe. With just a slight tangent to talk about Orbs for Kings.

Better yet, Nilay interviewed Verge reporter Russell Brandom about the Petya ransomware. It's a segment Russell calls "CyberTalk," but Nilay wants to call it "Brandom Security with Russell Brandom." Please vote in the comments.

1:00 - The iPhone turns 10

21:56 - iPhone or smartphones: which had the bigger impact?

31:50 - Petya ransomware in “Brandom Security with Russell Brandom” / “CyberTalk”

47:15 - Amazon Echo Show Review

55:31 - iOS 11 preview

66:00 - ARKit

72:30 - Paul’s weekly segment “Spin Safety”

74:50 - Galaxy Note 7 (Fandom Edition)

      <title>Bonus: Brian Merchant, author of The One Device</title>
      <description>We’re doing two episodes of The Vergecast this week — the usual one on Friday, and this very special edition with Brian Merchant, author of The One Device: The Secret History of the iPhone. 
We ran a big excerpt of the book this week, and we got deep on talking about the book, where it came from, and Merchant’s feeling that we should know more about the technology products in our lives — and know more about the hundreds of people who make them, from the unsung engineers at tech companies to the extremely unsung miners who dig the raw materials out of the ground.
And, of course, we talk about the quotes from Tony Fadell and Bill Bilbrey in the excerpt we just published, in which Fadell tells a story about Phil Schiller arguing the iPhone should have a hardware keyboard. Schiller has said the story isn’t true, and Fadell has tried to walk it back as well.
“So I wasn't in the room at Apple 10, 15 years ago when this would have happened,” says Merchant, who has the exchange on tape. “But this is a quote verbatim as Tony Fadell who was in the room told it to me. He told me this quote in such detail and he gave such a vivid account and I had no reason to believe it was untrue.”
Merchant says the controversy has “blown him away.” 
“It certainly wasn't intended to make Phil Schiller look dumb. It was an opposing viewpoint... I think that it's totally fine to be a dissenting voice and want to contextualize this emergent technology and even be opposed to it. Why would you not have someone in the room who is forcing people to think critically about this potentiality?”
There’s a lot more on the podcast, including a deep dive into the early research projects at Apple exploring touch interfaces.

      <title>Gadget news, FCC's final proposal, and Vlad</title>
      <description>Here’s The Vergecast. This week, Nilay, Dieter, and Paul plow through a week of news starting with (no surprise) the FCC’s ongoing mission to destroy net neutrality. This was also a week full of new gadgets — from the new Microsoft Surface Pro, to the Jamboard, to a $9,000 laptop, we walk you through the things we saw and reviewed in the Circuit Breaker world.
Also, even though we filled our time, we added a bonus segment in between it all: Vlad Savov, a fan favorite of the show, stops by and quickly breaks down what is on his mind and what gadgets have piqued his interests.
There’s a whole bunch of other stuff discussed on the show, (sorry, this show is an hour and a half), so listen through it all for more.  

03:27 - Breaking down the FCC’s proposal to destroy net neutrality

32:36 - Inside the mind of Vlad 

49:38 - And now, a brief definition of the web

51:03 - Microsoft's new Surface Pro has 13.5 hours of battery life and LTE option

56:22 - Microsoft has created a Surface USB-C dongle for “people who love dongles”

1:00:12 - DJI's $499 Spark is the company's cheapest and tiniest drone yet

1:04:43 - Google made a $5,000 whiteboard — and it’s weirdly fun

1:06:14 - Samsung responds to complaints about HDMI switching, will offer a firmware update 

1:10:57 - How Anker is beating Apple and Samsung at their own accessory game

1:11:54 - Acer Predator 21 X review

1:14:14 - Paul’s weekly segment “Vroom Vroom goes the car” 

1:17:00 - TV lightning round

      <title>Google I/O, Android O, and Assistant on the iPhone</title>
      <description>Fresh out of my export folder is a brand new episode of The Vergecast. This week, because of the business that is Google I/O, we recorded our episode Friday morning. This resulted in Nilay’s attempt to bring a morning show vibe to episode 257, despite Dieter, Adi, Natt, and Paul’s (and my) disapproval of sound effects. There was a lot to discuss thanks to Google’s developer conference, so here it is! Enjoy!

06:43 - Google is finally replacing its bad emoji blobs in Android O

13:59 - Google Assistant is on the iPhone now

24:41 - Google wants the Assistant to be everywhere — but first it needs to conquer the iPhone

31:46 - Android O

37:40 - Google is adding Kotlin as an official programming language for Android development

45:37 - Google AR / VR

1:01:25 - Ford update brings Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to its 2016 fleet

1:06:50 - New Surface Pro leak confirms Microsoft's hatred for USB-C

1:07:28 - AMD is bringing its new Ryzen processors to laptops later this year

1:08:15 - FCC votes to begin overturning net neutrality

      <title>Net neutrality special edition</title>
      <description>We’ve got a special edition episode of The Vergecast for you this week. On Thursday, the FCC put out a draft proposal for reversing the net neutrality order of 2015. The Verge has been following FCC chairman Ajit Pai’s actions in restoring “Internet Freedom” and how it will affect the internet for all of us. 
Nilay Patel invites news editor Jake Kastrenakes on the show, who has been reporting on this for the past few months, as well as senior reporter Adi Robertson, who reported on the FCC’s net neutrality rules back when this was a problem in 2014. The trio talk about the past, present, and future of the open internet and the FCC’s actions disrupting it. 
If you’re out of the loop or just need more information on this topic, now is the time to listen!

      <itunes:summary>We’ve got a special edition episode of The Vergecast for you this week. On Thursday, the FCC put out a draft proposal for reversing the net neutrality order of 2015. The Verge has been following FCC chairman Ajit Pai’s actions in restoring “Internet Freedom” and how it will affect the internet for all of us. 
Nilay Patel invites news editor Jake Kastrenakes on the show, who has been reporting on this for the past few months, as well as senior reporter Adi Robertson, who reported on the FCC’s net neutrality rules back when this was a problem in 2014. The trio talk about the past, present, and future of the open internet and the FCC’s actions disrupting it. 
If you’re out of the loop or just need more information on this topic, now is the time to listen!

And wow there’s a whole bunch of other stuff we talked about so listen through it all to keep feeding your brain

01:37 - Juicero offering refunds to all customers after people realize $400 juicer is totally unnecessary

06:34 - Samsung Galaxy S8 review: ahead of the curve

29:25 - Facebook F8 conference 2017

54:23 - Paul’s weekly segment “One day, not so far away, it may be possible for me to think in Mandarin and for you to feel instantly in Spanish” 

55:39 - Plastc swiped $9 million from backers and just completely vanished

59:35 - Nintendo is reportedly planning to launch a miniature SNES before Christmas

1:00:17 - Intel's next-generation SSD technology is finally ready and it's really, really fast

      <description>As you may have heard, The Vergecast is live this week at South by Southwest! We have one episode down and another one to go on Tuesday. 
On this special episode, Nilay and Dieter welcome Lauren Goode and Casey Newton on to talk the news outside of SXSW; in the tech world.

You can listen here, or watch the video on The Verge Facebook page.
 
03:55 - Google and Levi’s connected smart jacket will come out this fall and costs around $350

06:59 - Uptime is a goofy video sharing app from Google’s Area 120 startup incubator

09:13 - Facebook Messenger Day

19:52 - The Sonos Playbase is a $700 speaker that sits under your TV

26:19 - FCC’s walk back of ISP privacy rules

36:27 - Anchor is like Snapchat stories for audio, and it’s delightful

38:56 - Paul’s weekly segment “Friendship is like a Keurig”

41:39 - Latest Samsung Galaxy S8 leak gives us a close look at button changes

45:20 - LG G6 and the mobile/desktop dream

53:49 - Twitch replaced its homepage with a Twitter clone for gamers

Tune in Tuesday at 1:30 ET/12:30 CT/10:30 PT for another live episode!

      <title>Google Cloud Next Conference, Iron Fist, and Hot Tinder</title>
      <description>On this special episode of The Vergecast, the ladies of The Verge take over the show. Did you know that nearly half of the team is female? Seriously, we’re probably two women away from a 50 / 50 split, but you’d never know that if you only listened to The Vergecast! That’s why, in honor of International Women’s Day this week (and Women’s History Month all month!), we have Megan Farokhmanesh, Adi Robertson, Natt Garun, and Ashley Carman in the studio talking about Google’s big and enterprise-y week, Iron Fist, and the exclusive, invite-only version of Tinder for mega-hotties. Whatever that last thing is.

Culture reporter Kaitlyn Tiffany also joins in to tell us her account of the Women’s Day strike.

00:49 - International Women’s Day

10:49 - Google's giant 4K digital whiteboard, Jamboard, will cost $4,999

13:55 - Google’s Gboard will now translate text into another language as you type

15:32 - Google confirms small number of Pixel phones have broken microphones

17:35 - Google Hangouts is getting a major overhaul to take on Slack

21:39 - Google can now recognize objects in videos using machine learning

23:55 - Iron Fist isn't just racially uncomfortable, it's also a boring show

28:45 - There’s a secret version of Tinder for hot people and you can’t use it

36:31 - Ashley’s weekly segment “Yo, when will I be able to afford this phone case?”

39:32 - The CIA is hacking Samsung Smart TVs, according to WikiLeaks docs

      <title>Switch review, Galaxy S8 leaks, and iPhone with USB-C</title>
      <description>Usually I start these posts by apologizing, but ya know... by now I think you know what you’ve gotten yourself into — unless this is your first episode. So great! Hey! We’ve got a great show for you! (This is a podcast.) Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, Ross Miller, and Paul Miller (no relation) compiled a list of things from our cherished website TheVerge.com and dug a little deeper, with different angles, viewpoints, and behind-the-scenes journalistic insight.

We’ve got more time with the Nintendo Switch than we did last week (even a taste test), a roundup of MWC announcements from over the weekend, and tons of little stories. I’m sure there’s a bunch of stuff you missed because of the Amazon web server disruption since those four hours were the only time you get your news.

03:04 - Nintendo Switch review: pure potential

14:05 - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild review

21:33 - Amazon’s web servers are back online after more than four hours of disruption

24:34 - Samsung Galaxy S8 leaks in its full glory and The BlackBerry KeyOne resurrects the keyboard with style

30:08 - Google Assistant begins huge expansion across Android devices today

38:05 - 5G: Super fast data, throttled by reality

41:10 - The next iPhone won’t switch to USB-C, but its cable likely will

49:32 - Paul’s weekly segment “Hey look at me now”

51:55 - FCC chairman says net neutrality was a mistake

58:40 - YouTube launches its own streaming TV service

1:02:20 - Amazon is working on its own home security camera

1:03:47 - Spotify is preparing to launch a Hi-Fi music tier

23:24 - Solving the mystery behind the OP1 processor in the Chromebook Plus

41:44 - MWC preview: LG G6 / Scissor vodka anniversary

47:44 - Verizon is planning 5G tests in 11 cities this year

      <title>Planet of the Apps, Verizon unlimited, and Sonos audio</title>
      <description>Hey, y’all. This week’s episode of Vergecast is the first in our new studio. And our heroes (Nilay, Paul, and Dieter, in case you were unaware) are still getting used to it. But you can’t see them while you’re listening, so it doesn’t really matter! It’s a new look but it has the same great taste. Topics on this week’s show include: lots of TV talk, including Apple TV and Caavo; more unlimited data plans; a bit of consumer audio speak; and a few anecdotes and reviews sprinkled in.

And Megan Farokhmanesh stops by briefly to talk about her experience using a new dating app called Hater. Does she love it or hate it? Tune in to find out.

02:17 - Code Media

03:23 - Apple headlines, iPhone 8 rumors

09:58 - TV stuff

14:34 - Planet of the Apps

21:54 - Caavo

33:32 - Verizon’s new unlimited data plan

40:52 - Hater app with Megan

46:48 - Paul’s weekly segment “Dieter wouldn’t let me make a slurping noise for the name of this segment”

49:08 - This Belle doll will dance for you, but only if you attempt to code

53:08 - Sonos news / consumer audio talk

1:02:28 - Android apps on Chrome OS

      <title>Snap Inc IPO, ARM processors in Macbooks, and Apple earnings</title>
      <description>Vergecast episode 241! This week, Nilay and Dieter bring back Ross Miller and Megan Farokhmanesh to assist covering the news from this week. Snap Inc. filed for a $3 billion IPO, Apple is reportedly putting ARM chips in Macs, and Facebook is making a TV app. In between all that listen to Nilay’s take on fire logs, Dieter’s experience with a Zelda-themed escape room, and the wackiness of internet culture from Megan and Ross.

Nilay and Dieter apologized for this episode to me personally — but really, we covered a lot and had a good time so I think they’re just being hard on themselves. Enjoy!

03:37 - Snap Inc IPO

08:41 - Facebook wants to build app for set-top boxes

16:21 - Duraflame

18:37 - Apple earnings

31:42 - MacBook Touch Bar barred from bar test takers this February

35:50 - ARM processors in MacBooks

40:07 - Why politics shows up on our site a lot lately

49:47 - Zelda escape the room

51:31 - We Are Your Friends

56:56 - Ross’ weekly segment “Gadgetorial? Counterpoint”

1:03:15 - Lightning round

      <title>Net neutrality, Final Fantasy, Gilmore Girls, and the Spectacles line</title>
      <description>Welcome to Vergecast Lonely Paul edition. Dieter and Nilay are out this week, so Paul enlisted some of his colleagues who would never let him down like that and made his own Vergecast that's centered around talking to people not named Dieter or Nilay. Want to learn what AT&amp;T's new DirecTV Now service has to do with net neutrality? Want to figure out why nearly all women and nearly everybody actually loves Gilmore Girls? Want to know if video games are good sometimes? Want to experience what it would be like to stand in line for Snapchat Spectacles but not actually purchase Spectacles because you hate lines? Then you'll probably love what we've done here.

2:39 – Interview with T.C. Sottek on net neutrality

33:24 – Interview with Kaitlyn Tiffany on Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life

52:38 – Interview with Andrew Webster on Pokemon Sun and Moon and Final Fantasy XV

1:06:30 – Interview with Ashley Carman live at the Snapchat Spectacles line in NYC

      <title>Daydream, Playstation Pro, Snapchat, and Instagram</title>
      <description>Here we are, a few days after the election. With the world still adjusting to the future, we thought we’d give you a break from it all and briefly talk about what we know best: the future of technology. This week we have reviews for the Playstation 4 Pro and Google Daydream, the continuing saga of adapting to a plug drought, and Snapchat’s new Spectacles that were released to the public this week. 

So sit back, relax, (unless you are driving... if you’re driving and listening to this please focus on the road), and let us fill you in with the Verge updates you may have missed this week.

      <title>Verge turns 5, Google Home, and Assistant </title>
      <description>Happy Vergecast day! Look we’ve got a new logo!

This week, in honor of The Verge’s fifth anniversary and the redesign of the website, we start off the show by giving some behind-the-scenes details on the new things you see on the site and things we’ve changed.

But don’t worry, we still have that weekly news you all subscribe for. Nilay, Dieter, Paul, and Dan discuss using the Google Home speaker and how it works with the Google Assistant. Also, we have reviews of the 13-inch Macbook Pro (yeah the one without the Touch Bar), Paul’s weekly segment “Cookie Pods,” and some great ad reads in between.

01:49 - The Verge turns 5

15:58 - Google Home

27:49 - Google Assistant

40:35 - Macbook Pro

1:06:27 - Paul’s weekly segment “Cookie Pods”

We want to thank the listeners, new and old, for tuning in each and giving feedback on the show, we greatly appreciate it.

A quote from Nilay on this week’s episode:

“We launched The Verge basically on the back of this podcast. This podcast when Paul and I were doing it with Josh as the Engadget podcast was so popular that we could fucking leave and start a new podcast, our listeners came with us, and we were able to launch This Is My Next and then The Verge so it’s wild that we’ve done it for five years.”

      <title>ARM, EFF, and SDCC</title>
      <description>With a classic cast of Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, Paul Miller, and Lauren Goode, we have a very nerdy episode of Vergecast this week. For starters, there’s the news about SoftBank buying chip maker ARM, then the Electric Frontier Foundation filing a lawsuit that takes on anti-circumvention rules. The gang also goes deep into nostalgia with classic consumer electronics.
But we couldn’t leave it at that. Paul interviews our own senior reporter Bryan Bishop, who calls in live from San Diego Comic-Con to tell us what he’s seen so far at the convention. To top it all off, we go into the nerdiest part of the celebrity feud between Kayne West and Taylor Swift, which leads to the cast going through their own note-taking apps.
08:20 – Softbank buys ARM
24:45 – Paul’s "Gadget shhecrets"
29:20 – EFF copyright lawsuit
37:40 – Nostalgia note
44:24 – SDCC interview with Bryan Bishop
56:26 – Taylor Swift / Kanye West / Kim Kardashian feud
1:02:57 – Note app game

      <title>The state of Android, smartwatches and Twitter hearts</title>
      <description>This week brought no shortage of topics to discuss, but one item stood out among the smoke and mirrors. Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, and Dan Seifert are joined by Nicola Fumo of Racked in the hypeseat to discuss the state of smartwatches, what might happen with Google's two operating systems, and of course, the new branded vape from musical artist The Weeknd. It's not one to miss.

      <title>Apple TV, universal remotes, and the joy of dropping phones</title>
      <description>It was a good week to arguing about the state of television, with both Apple and Roku releasing new content delivery boxes. A trio of original Verge editors — Nilay Patel, Chris Ziegler, and Ross Miller — are joined by Helen Havlak in the Hype seat. In between heated debates about universal remotes and IR blasters, our Fab Four find time to talk about HTC's One A9 and — quite literally — toss around the new "drop-proof" Droid Turbo 2. Don't worry, you'll hear it.

      <description>This week on the Vergecast, Joanna Stern invades to talk about the Surface Book and the Surface Pro 4 — and Tom Warren joins the invasion over Skype. And for the first time, the Hype Council of Kirsten Frisina, Loren Grush, and Kaitlyn Tiffany sit in judgement of the Nexus 6P and YouTube Red. Along with Dieter and Nilay, that's seven humans. It doesn't get more Vergecast than this.

      <title>Peek, pop, whip, and nae nae</title>
      <description>A day after Apple’s huge event, we ran through all the big announcements. The Hype Seat has transformed into the Skype Seat so that Casey Newton can join Dieter Bohn, Jake Kastrenakes, and Chris Welch. Is the Apple TV just a super Roku? Just how Surface-y is the new iPad Pro? If you 3D Touch a 2D screen in a 1D forest, does it make a sound? All these questions will be answered with a Live Shot, except instead of a moving picture it’s a podcast.

      <title>Netflix Bedtime</title>
      <description>What ever happened to predictability? Well, we're throwing it out the window today, as special guests Liz Lopatto and Kwame Opam join Nilay and Sam, with a very special crossover cameo at the top of the show. It's a rare condition, this day and age, to read any good news on the newspaper page, so it's a mixed bag of topics this week. We've got Furious 7, Microsoft's newest Surface, the ongoing Californian drought, Amazon Dash and Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. Only time will tell if all these dreams fit under one umbrella, but we hope you enjoy.

      <title>Ikecheck</title>
      <description>We've captured lightning in a bottle this week. We somehow managed to record The Vergecast in the brief moments between the Arizonan llamas and the white-gold-blue-black dress debate. It was a moment of clarity, a calm we didn't know we should have savored. Journey back with us to that simpler time, and hear Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, Chris Ziegler, and Sam Sheffer weigh in on the FCC's net neutrality ruling, the price of an Apple Watch, the upcoming Galaxy S 6, and the classic 1992 romantic thriller, The Bodyguard.

      <title>In the Tweet Mix</title>
      <description>This week's show includes a very special attempt at an actual introduction. That's right, we're rolling out the red carpet for Nicholas Carlson, Business Insider's chief correspondent. The professionalism doesn't last for long, though, as we quickly devolve into the mathematical definition of a hypecheck, the FCC's role in the future of the internet, and Apple's new take on photo management.

      <title>Hypecheck</title>
      <description>To some, it's a black-and-white answer. To others, it's a subtle gray. Some say hype can't be felt, only psychically perceived. It's a beacon of hope, a pillar of truth. We cannot see it, but we know it exists. It's everywhere and nowhere, all at once. We follow its call, but fear its power. We may never agree about what hype truly is, but that doesn't matter. We all know deep down inside that what really counts is that hype is in us all: teeming, stirring, ready to be checked.

      <title>An Incorrect Oral History of Vaping</title>
      <description>Following an immediate but brief foray into Nilay Patel’s dark memoir-in-progress, the Vergecast progresses nicely into a week chock full of news, led by Nilay, Dieter Bohn, and David Pierce. We have Google’s new Nexus lineup, Apple’s new iPads and iMac, a brave new email paradigm, and Twitter’s content problems. Then, for some reason, there was some mild debate about the nature of vaping, but you’ll have to listen to fully grasp that thread.

      <title>A Meter of Sweat</title>
      <description>Chris Plante joins Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn on this week's Vergecast to read his unstructured, free verse poetry about the HTC Re Camera. Or maybe it's Re Poetry. Either way, let's just be thankful that there's not a macron diacritical mark above the "e" in Re, that way lies madness. We also discuss Apple before taking a hard turn into talking about what's happening in Gamergate.

      <description>The Vergecast is back with Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, and Tom Warren. No iPhones were bent in the creation of this episode, nor were any bricked by rogue iOS updates. Microsoft's product strategy turned out to be remarkably similar to Taco Bell's, we discovered, and then there was the robot. The robot is definitely trying to kill us.

      <description>Yes, finally: The Vergecast is really back, and there's a whole lot to talk about. This week, Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, and David Pierce get together to discuss their impressions of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, Amazon's slew of new tablets, and Microsoft's purchase of Minecraft. Oh, and Dora the Explorer too.
